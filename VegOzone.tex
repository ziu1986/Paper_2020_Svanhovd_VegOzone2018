\begin{abstract}
  An increased occurrence of persistent heatwaves, as one possible future scenario, generates favorable conditions for the formation of ambient air ozone. Vegetation highly specialized to sub-arctic climate is vulnerable to rapid environmental changes inflicted by global warming and might become more susceptible to ozone in the future. Over large parts of Europe the summer 2018 had been extraordinarily hot and dry and caused large wildfires in northern Sweden in particular. This can be regarded as a test case for such a future scenario. In both 2018 and 2019, we have monitored ambient air ozone concentrations at the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO) Environment Centre Svanhovd in Northern Norway. Due to data acquisition problems, ozone concentrations for two weeks in July 2018 were missing from our record. We present a reconstruction based on probability density function with respect to the Swedish and Finnish atmospheric monitoring sites in the region. Over all, ozone concentrations did not differ significantly between the two years. While temperatures and global irradiance diverged significantly from multi annual mean, precipitation varied only to some extend. Coincidentally, we have observed ozone-induced visible injuries on clovers in the ozone garden at Svanhovd in 2018, but not in 2019. We investigate the difference in uptake of ozone using the DO3SE model, with respect to the typical vegetation (beech/birch and conifers) at the location. We assess whether critical levels for these species were breached during the summer seasons. We find that an unadjusted transfer of currently used standard parameters and methodes on ozone damage assessment (IPC Mapping Manual) to vegetation in the subarctics will result in an missinterpretation of POD1 values. {\bf TODO: Results. Difference in POD1 compared to mapping manual parameterization.}

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
\label{sec:intro}

Tropospheric and in particular ambient air ozone is a highly toxic pollutant to all ecosystems. In continuously high concentration, ozone negatively affects life expectancy of humans \citep{WHO2008} and is cause to early senescence as well as programmed cell death in plants \citep{PCE:Kangasjarvi2005}. On average, a global loss of yield in four major crops (wheat, rice, maize, and soybean) of $3-15\,\unit{\%}$ \citep{PJ:Ainsworth2017} and a loss in primary production in forestry of $7\,\unit{\%}$ \citep{GCB:Wittig2009,EP:Matyssek2012} has been attributed to ozone. Former can proof a vital threat to food security in fast developing countries, e.g., in East and South-East Asia \citep{GCB:Tang2013,NCC:Tai2014,AE:Chuwah2015,GCB:Mills2018}, where ozone related to air pollution has increased in the past years. At the same time, a successful implementation of air quality regulations reduced the number of episodes of peak concentrations especially in summertime over Europe and North America \citep[e.g.,][]{ESA:Fleming2018, ESA:Mills2018}.

With a radiative forcing of $0.40 \pm 0.20\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$, ozone is a potent climate forcer, ranked third behind \chem{CO_2} and \chem{CH_4} \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}. Its damaging effects on global vegetation might provide an important additional feedback to climate change \citep{Nat:Sitch2007}.

In the presents of nitrogen oxides (\chem{NO_x}), tropospheric ozone is formed in complex photochemical cycles involving precursor gases such as carbon monoxide (\chem{CO}) and hydrocarbons known as volatile organic substances (VOCs). In the absence of local pollution sources, episodes of high ozone concentrations are often attributed to long-range transport of precursors. In northern Fennoscandia, episodes in 2003 and 2006 have been traced back to emissions related to forest fires in southern and eastern Europe, respectively \citep{AE:Lindskog2007,EP:Karlsson2013}. Hydrocarbons are also emitted by living vegetation in form of terpenes and monoterpenes, so called biogenic volatile substances (BVOCs). Those emissions are associated with, e.g., thermal stress, defense against herbivores, or attraction of pollinators \citep{TPS:Penuelas2003}.

Despite a relatively short tropospheric life-time of roughly $22\,\unit{days}$, ranging from a few days in the tropical boundary layer to up to $1\,\unit{year}$ in the upper troposphere \citep{JGR:Stevenson2005,ACP:Young2013}, ozone is subject to advection over long distances.
In the annual cycle, a distinct maximum typically occurs in spring followed by lower concentrations throughout the summer. This is most likely due to stronger dry deposition on land vegetation than on bare ground or snow and ice \citep{AE:Monks2000}. This spring peak is reached earlier in northern Fennoscandia than in more southern locations but is highly variable throughout the years \citep{AB:Klingberg2009, BER:Klingberg2019}. A cause for this is a complex interplay between atmospheric dynamics and chemistry \citep{AE:Laurila1996,BER:Hatakka2003} as well as anthropogenic and biogenic activity \citep{AE:Rummukainen1996,AE:Simpson2002,QJRMS:Galbally2007,NGS:Schnell2009}. \citet{ACP:Andersson2017} showed in a modeling study focused on Fennoscandia that the variability in winter can be attributed mainly to changes in atmospheric background (transport) of ozone, while summertime abundance is mostly affected by emissions of precursors in the rest of Europe. Meteorology plays an important role throughout the year.

At the same time, the start of growing season in northern Fennoscandia is shifting to earlier days of the year in response to the general warming trend \citep[e.g.,]{GCB:Menzel2006,RS:Hogda2013,IJB:Karlsen2007} and thereby into close vicinity of the ozone spring peak. This may promote a higher susceptibility of deciduous species to ozone.

Since the industrial revolution, tropospheric background concentrations of ozone in the northern hemisphere have doubled and kept increasing until recently. But long-term observations started before 1950 are scarce \citep[Chapter 2]{IPCC2013}. Recent trend analyses indicate that a maximum was reached in 2007 \citep{AE:Derwent2018}, after which tropospheric ozone started to level-off or even decline \citep{ACP:Wespes2018,ESA:Gaudel2018}.\\

\emph{Contributor: Ane} {\bf TODO: More detailed ozone damage description?}\\
Ozone acts as an oxidative stress to plants. Its main action is imposed through reactions occurring in the cell walls and cell membranes of mesophyll cells inside the leaves. Ozone enters the leaves through stomata, that are kept open to allow for gas exchange between the leaf air spaces and the exterior air. When the stomata are closed, ozone does not enter.

The opening of stomata, quantified through their conductance to water vapor $g_\mathrm{sto}$, is governed by different environmental factors and can be described by a multiplicative ansatz \citep{PTRS:Jarvis1976,ICP:MappingManual2017}:
\begin{equation}
  g^k_\text{sto, m} = g^k_\text{max, m} \cdot f^k_\text{phen} \cdot f^k_\text{light} \cdot \max{\left\{f^k_\text{min}, f^k_T \cdot f^k_D \cdot f^k_\text{SW}\right\}}.
  \label{eq:stomatal}
\end{equation}
%
The factors herein are normalized and vary within a range $0-1$. They are empirically determined and account for leaf phenology ($f_\text{phen}$), light ($f_\text{light}$), temperature ($f_T$), water vapor pressure deficit ($f_D$), and soil water content ($f_\text{SW}$). All factors differ with plant functional type (PFT) $k$.

The temperature adjustment function
%
\begin{equation}
  f_T = \frac{T_\text{2m}-T_\text{min}}{T_\text{opt}-T_\text{min}} \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{max}}-T_\text{2m}}{T_{\text{max}}-T_\text{opt}}\right)^\beta,
  \label{eq:f_temp}
\end{equation}
with $\beta = \frac{T_\text{max}-T_\text{opt}}{T_\text{opt}-T_\text{min}}$ is a mixed reciprocal polynomial function of temperature. The shape parameters $T_\text{min}$, $T_\text{max}$ and $T_\text{opt}$ are tabulated for various plant functional types.
%
the water vapor pressure deficit penalty factor
%
\begin{equation}
  f_D = f_\text{min}+(1-f_\text{min}) \cdot \frac{D_\text{min} - \text{VPD}}{D_\text{min}-D_\text{max}}.
  \label{eq:f_vpd}
\end{equation}
%
with $f_\text{min}$, $D_\text{min}$, $D_\text{max}$ describes the stomata reaction to imminent heat stress.

The wavelength band $400-700\,\unit{nm}$ plant chlorophyll responds to is called photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Its integral is the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). The correction factor $f_\mathrm{light}$ in dependency of PPFD is:
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{light} = 1-\text{exp}(-\alpha_\text{light}\cdot \text{PPFD}).
  \label{eq:flight}
\end{equation}


\citet{ACP:Bueker2012} discusses several formulations available to describe the reduction in stomata conductance due to water content in the soil.

To measure the risk of damage inflicted to vegetation through ozone, many different metrics have been defined. Two main types can be differentiated, concentration-based (e.g., $\mathrm{AOT_{40}}$) and flux-based (e.g.,$\mathrm{POD_{0.1}}$) metrics. Due to their simplicity, $\mathrm{AOT_{x}}$ are still widely used, despite the actual integrated flux of ozone entering through the stomata is more relevant for an estimation of the actual toxic dose \citep{ICP:MappingManual2017}. 
The Accumulated Ozone Exposure over a threshold concentration of $\mathrm{x}$ in units of $\unit{ppb}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{AOT_x} = \int{\mathrm{max(\chem{[O_3]}-x)}\cdot \mathrm{dt}},
  \label{eq:aot}
\end{equation}
with the ambient ozone concentration $\chem{[O_3]}$. The integration time varies, but is usually defined from $8\,\unit{am}-8\,\unit{pm}$.
The Phototoxic Ozone Dose (POD) over a threshold y is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{POD_y} = \int{\mathrm{max(\Phi_\chem{[O_3]}-y)}\cdot \mathrm{dt}},
  \label{eq:pod}
\end{equation}
with the ambient ozone flux through the stomata $\Phi_\chem{[O_3]} = g_\mathrm{sto} \cdot \chem{[O_3]}$ and a flux threshold $\mathrm{y}$ representing the detoxification potential of the plant. The stomatal conductance is either measured directly or computed in accordance to Eq.~(\ref{eq:stomatal}).\\


According to a report by the Norwegian Meteorological institute \citep{MetNOR2019}, the summer of 2018 was the warmest and driest ever recorded in eastern, western, and southern Norway. In the north (including Finnmark), it was amongst the warmest on record -- favorable conditions for boundary layer ozone formation.

An unusually weak and northward shifted jet stream allowed for a persistent high pressure system above northern Europe, including Fennoscandia which blocked the pressure systems for several consecutive months. In the period May -- July, southern Norway had temperatures $4\,\unit{^\circ C}$ above normal. While southern Norway had only about $60\,\unit{\%}$ of normal precipitation, northern Norway as a whole had close to normal precipitation, but with local variations.

Heat and drought stress on vegetation was exceptional not only in large parts of Fennoscandia but also in much of Europe, where the influence of the high pressure system extended even over a period of five months (April/May, July--September). These conditions gave rise to massive forest fires in different parts of Europe and thus an increase in ozone precursors. Boreal wildfires emit in addition to \chem{CO_2} also \chem{CO} ($\chem{[CO]}/\chem{[CO_2]} \propto 6-13\,\unit{\%}$) and \chem{VOCs} ($\chem{[VOCs]}/\chem{[CO_2]} \propto 0.5-1.5\,\unit{\%}$) \citep{AE:Cofer1990}.

A total of 2079 forest fires of different size were registered in Norway in 2018, twice as many as in the preceding years 2016/17 \citep{DSB2019}, last accessed April 2020). In Sweden, about 500 fires had been reported (five times more than in a usual summer) and an estimated total of $25000\,\unit{hectare}$ burned down in the course of the most extensive fires in central Sweden (G\"{a}vleborgs, J\"{a}mtlands, and Dalarnas l\"{a}n) in younger history \citep{SOU2019}.

Elevated ozone in Europe was likely due to several other factors as well, like in the 2003 drought period, such as biogenic VOC emissions, reduced dry deposition, reduced clouds and increased solar radiation, photochemical reactions, and stagnant weather conditions \citep{JGR:Solberg2018}.\\

In terms of $\mathrm{AOT_{40}}$, the threshold for protection of vegetation of $3000\,\unit{ppb}$ (integrated over the growing season) given by the EU directive has been well exceeded at many ozone monitoring sites in Southern Norway in the 2018 growing season \citep{NILU2019}. {\bf TODO: come back to this later on in the discussions(?) - it has not been breached at Svanvik in northern Fennoscandia.}

Within the scope of our project to assess probable effects of midnight sun conditions on ozone uptake by plants and resultant enhanced susceptibility to ozone inflicted damage, we conducted ambient air ozone concentration measurements at Svanhovd in the growing seasons of 2018/19 in collaboration with the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU). 
In 2018, we have observed ozone damage on semi-natural vegetation (clover) and crops (tobacco) in the ozone garden at the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO) Environment Centre Svanhovd. In contrast, no such damage was found on the clovers in 2019, although it was found on the sensitive tobacco cultivar. This indicates that the vegetation may have been more affected by ozone in 2018 than in 2019.
The respective observed average ozone concentration in 2018/19, however, did not differ significantly by statistical means.

As previously mentioned, ozone damage is rather driven by the actual uptake of ozone ($\mathrm{POD_y}$) than by the accumulated ambient air concentration above a certain threshold ($\mathrm{AOT_x}$). Through the stomatal conductance, $\mathrm{POD_y}$ depends on environmental drivers such as ambient air temperature, photoactive radiation, soil water availability, and water vapor pressure deficit.

In this study, we investigate potential main drivers for the observed ozone damage in the growing season 2018 at NIBIO Environment Centre Svanhovd in contrast to 2019. We compare $\mathrm{POD_y}$ values for natural and semi-natural vegetation for derived climatological averages of environmental conditions at Svanhovd as well as for the growing seasons 2018/19 which shall serve as case studies.

The observation site at NIBIO Environment Centre Svanhovd and all related data are presented in Section~\ref{sec:data}. In Section~\ref{sec:stats}, we derive climatologies for surface ozone concentration at Svanhovd and northern Fennoscandia based on in situ observations and also compute climatologies of surface temperature, precipitation, and global radiation for Svanhovd. Based on these, we evaluate anomalies of environmental key variables in 2018/19 by statistical means. In addition, the derived surface ozone concentration climatology for northern Fennoscandia will be compared with available ozone reanalysis products. We use the DO3SE model to estimate the ozone uptake by natural and semi-natural vegetation to investigate the main environmental driver of the observed ozone damage in 2018 (Section~\ref{sec:do3se}). In Section~\ref{sec:conc} finally, we will summarize our results, draw conclusions, and give an outlook on further work.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

In our assessment of ozone damage on vegetation in the subarctic in relation to the 2018 heatwave, we focus on the NIBIO operated Environment Centre Svanhovd which lies close by the settlement of Svanvik in the Pasvik valley (Section~\ref{subsec:svanhovd}). Throughout the paper, we will use Svanhovd synonymously for the atmospheric monitoring site at Svanvik. The available meteorological monitoring data are described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik}. In Section~\ref{subsubsec:ozone_garden}, the ozone garden -- a plant-based ozone monitoring -- will be described in more detail. Other data used for evaluation of the ozone data taken at Svanhovd is described in Section~\ref{subsec:other_data}. We compare with observational data from other monitoring sites in northern Fennoscandia (Section~\ref{subsubsec:ebas}) and use as well reanalysis products (Section~\ref{subsubsec:ozone_rea}) as complement when observational data was not available.

\subsection{NIBIO Environment Centre Svanhovd}
\label{subsec:svanhovd}
"Svanhovd is located beside the Pasvik river, in the middle of the wedge of Norwegian land separating Russia and Finland in the north. It is where the eastern Siberian taiga meets the western Boreal forest. [...] Svanhovd was originally established as a State Demonstration and Experimental Farm in the 1930's, in order to expand agriculture in Pasvik valley [...]" - \href{https://www.nibio.no/en/about-eng/addresses/northern-norway/svanhovd}{NIBIO web page, accessed March 2020}.

The locations of the atmospheric monitoring site as well as the ozone garden with respect to the main buildings of the Svanhovd Environment Centre are marked in the aerial photography shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:svanhovd_research_station}. The Centre is located south of the settlement of Svanvik, where as the border to Russia, the Pasvik river, lies only a few hundred meters to the east. The original farm buildings, protected by law, are located in the lower center, while the Svanhovd Environment Centre follows to the north-east. Left of the Centre and north of the original farm buildings a botanical garden can be found. It is one amongst three such gardens north of the Polar Circle. The Svanhovd Environment Centre focuses on research of the special environment of the region, but also comprises long-term observations of various agrometeorological variables, i.a. $2\,\unit{m}$ temperature, precipitation, global irradiance, and soil temperature at different depths.

For the purpose of relating observed damage on ozone sensitive plants (e.g. clover and tobacco) to local ozone concentrations, an ozone monitor had been installed during the growing seasons 2018/19. The relevant data are described in more detail in Section~\ref{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik}.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Atmospheric monitoring}
\label{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik}
For the growing seasons 2018/19, monitoring data of key variables (temperature, precipitation, and ozone) have been downloaded from \href{luftkvalitet.no}{luftkvalitet.no} which is operated by NILU.

All agrometeorological variables including temperature and precipitation are available from September 1992 to present day (LandbruksMeteorologisk Tjeneste provided by NIBIO -- \href{https://lmt.nibio.no/}{lmt.nibio.no}, note the station name here is Pasvik).

{\bf TODO: Some more (technical) details about ozone and atmospheric monitoring at Svanhovd? $\rightarrow$ Sverre?}

\emph{Comment: We refrain from doing a full cross-evaluation for these meteorological fields, since this has been done elsewhere. It's somewhat clear that this is a job of the operators in the monitoring network \citep{MetNOR2019}.}

Relevant data for the growing season 2018/19 are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}. The hatched areas mark times when no ozone data was recorded. Note, while the downtime during winter was planned, missing data in two weeks of July 2018 (July 9--23) were due to problems in data acquisition.

Ozone concentrations \chem{[O_3]} measured in $2\,\unit{m}$ height above ground are averaged hourly. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}a), \chem{[O_3]} peaks in spring (April/May) and reaches its minimum in late summer (July/August). The spring peak has not been captured completely in 2019, for data acquisition started later than in 2018. In summer 2018 (June--August), high ozone concentrations ($\chem{[O_3]} > 40\,\unit{ppb}$) were recorded 50 times. The highest summer ozone concentration ($\chem{[O_3]} = 50.2\,\unit{ppb}$) was measured on July 25. This coincides with the period of the most extensive forest fires in central Swedish (G\"{a}vleborgs, J\"{a}mtlands, and Dalarnas l\"{a}n) which occurred from July 12--29 and destroyed about $18000\,\unit{hectare}$ of forest \citep{SOU2019}. However, due to the above mentioned data acquisition problems, we missed most of the corresponding ozone data for this event and most likely also the peak ozone concentration. In contrast, ozone concentration only rose 18 times above the threshold of $40\,\unit{ppb}$ during the summer of 2019.

Hourly averaged $2\,\unit{m}$ temperatures below $-20\,\unit{^\circ C}$ were observed in winter (January/February), while high temperatures (above $20\,\unit{^\circ C}$) occurred in summer (July), though more regularly in 2018 than in 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}b). In 2018, temperature regularly rose above freezing only in May, while in 2019 this occurred already early in March/April. 2019 saw a very cold November with temperatures regularly below $-10\unit{^\circ C}$.

More rain events with accumulated daily precipitation $\sum_d \mathrm{Precip}$ above $10\,\unit{mm}$ occurred in the summer of 2018 compared to 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}c). $\sum_d \mathrm{Precip} \ge 20\,\unit{mm}$ was only breached twice in 2018 and once in 2019.

In 2018, global irradiance $Q_0$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}d) displays more sequentially high values in spring (May) and summer (July) compared to 2019, while June 2019 saw more consecutive high irradiance than 2018. In both years, the maximum recorded $Q_0$ was roughly $750\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$ reached only in June.

\label{subsubsec:ozone_garden}
      {\bf TODO: Details about the ozone garden and observed damage on ozone sensitive plants. We will need to come back to this in the discussion section after the Do3se modeling part.} \emph{Author: Ane/Aud -- pictures are welcome, just upload them on overleaf or send them to me.}



\subsection{Other data}
\label{subsec:other_data}
To determine the significance of the ozone conditions in 2018, we have to derive a surface ozone concentration climatology for Svanvik. From 1986--1996 ozone monitoring has been operated by NILU at Svanhovd, but no ozone measurements have been conducted for the past $14\,\unit{years}$. Due to probable changes in northern hemispheric tropospheric background ozone and a reduction of summertime peak values related to ozone precursors that fell under air quality regulations {\bf TODO: Citations!}, we also have to have a look at ozone observations at other sites in northern Fennoscandia. In regard to ozone, available observational data are sparse in this region. An overview over the geographical locations of conducted atmospheric monitoring in the past and present is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:station_map_fennoscandia}. The data is described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:ebas}. 
As additional complement to observational data which is not available at all times and spatially sparse, we also look at various ozone reanalysis products (Section~\ref{subsubsec:ozone_rea}).

  \label{fig:station_map_fennoscandia}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Surface ozone observations}
\label{subsubsec:ebas}
All surface ozone observations used in this study are available from the EBAS database operated by NILU (\href{http://ebas.nilu.no/}{ebas.nilu.no}). In Table~\ref{tab:ebas_obs}, we give an overview over the exact locations and time range of operational data taking. All stations with available long term observations are located on higher ground than Svanhovd which will result in higher surface ozone concentrations in comparison as ozone abundance, in general, decreases with decreasing altitude in the absence of local precursors. {\bf TODO: Citation see references in \citet{AB:Klingberg2009}!} The periphery vegetation at all sites is similar and consists mainly of pine forests, birch, and heath. However, at close vicinity it varies substantially. Ozone measurements at Pallas are taken on top of mount Sammaltunturi $100\,\unit{m}$ above tree line (pine forest) and mainly consists of low vascular plants, mosses, and lichen \citep{BER:Hatakka2003}. At Svanhovd, the ozone measurements are taken amidst a meadow surrounded by agriculturally managed herbaceous plants and grass (c.c. Fig.\ref{fig:svanhovd_research_station}).

Data from before the 1990s is available solely from Svanvik and Karasjok. These data, however, do not follow the high quality standard procedures implemented nowadays and have to be treated with care \citep{NILU2003}. Especially, ozone monitors did not undergo a regular re-calibration. This probably leads to drifts in the observed data and may impose a false periodicity. In 1997, the ozone monitoring at Jergul was relocated downstream the river Karasjokka to a site close by Karasjok. Although the same equipment has been used, this might have introduced a breaking point in the combined data series, denoted as Jergul/Karasjok in the following, which would be of a problem if this was the sole data to compare with. Only few data have been taken upstream the Pasvik river at Janiskovski, hence these will not be taken into further consideration, but are shown for completion. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_timesseries_fenoscandic_obs}, there is an overlap of about $4\,\unit{years}$ between data taken at Esrange, Jergul/Karasjok, and Svanvik. The hatched areas indicate time periods with insufficient quality control as mentioned above.

\subsubsection{Ozone reanalysis}
\label{subsubsec:ozone_rea}

Details of reanalysis data sets referred to in this work are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ozone_rea}.
There are two global reanalysis products available at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that include atmospheric tracers, in particular ozone (MACC and CAMSRA) \citep{ACP:Inness2013, ACP:Inness2019}. The temporal as well as spatial resolution of these reanalysis products is rather coarse: 3-hourly and $0.75^\circ\times 0.75^\circ$ or roughly $29.3\,\unit{km}\times 83.4\,\unit{km}$ at the location of Svanvik, respectively. In addition, higher resolution surface ozone reanalysis for whole Europe is available from Copernicus service for regional air quality control ({\bf TODO: From May 31st on through the CAMS Atmosphere Data Store (ADS)}). The regional air quality model reanalysis ensemble (CAMS regional Ensemble) is based on nine European state-of-the-art numerical air quality models ({\bf TODO: Reference -  https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/documentation-regional-systems, last accessed April 2020}). The ensemble mean is at fairly high spatial and temporal resolution compared to the global reanalysis from ECMWF: $0.1^\circ\times 0.1^\circ$ or roughly $3.9\,\unit{km}\times 11.1\,\unit{km}$ and 1-hourly, respectively. The covered time periods differ and no data are available for before the turn of the millennium. The CAMSRA and CAMS Regional Air Quality ensemble mean are available in near real time, but only former covers a period of sufficient length for climate analysis (2003 -- present). All reanalyses use different but, at that time, latest versions of the operational weather forecast system (OpenIFS) from ECMWF. They differ substantially in the assimilated observational ozone data. The MACC reanalysis assimilates only satellite derived tropospheric column ozone (TC), while CAMSRA also includes ozone profiles from satellite retrievals. Most importantly for our study, in situ observations from ozone surface station networks are only assimilated in the CAMS Regional Ensemble. The quality with respect to observations in northern Fennoscandia will be discussed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:clim_ozone}. Without too much foreshadowing, the results prevented us from fetching the whole CAMSRA data.

\section{Statistical analysis of environmental key variables}
\label{sec:stats}
In this section, we will evaluate atmospheric conditions in the growing seasons of 2018/19 by statistical means. We will derive climatologies for both, temperature, precipitation, global irradiance, and ozone for Svanvik (Section~\ref{subsec:climatologies}). The ozone measurements will be put into a climatological as well as regional context. We will look at anomalies of the atmospheric key variable mentioned above (Section~\ref{subsec:anomalies}).

\subsection{Derived climatologies}
\label{subsec:climatologies}

\subsubsection{Temperature, precipitation, and global irradiance}
\label{subsubsec:clim_temp_prec}
The location of Svanvik at $69.45\,\unit{^\circ N}$ suggests a subarctic climate. The derived climate diagram following Walter and Lieth shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:climatediagram} supports this very well. The diagram is based on climatological data from Svanvik (1992--2012) downloaded from LandbruksMeteorologiske Tjeneste. Monthly averaged temperatures (red line) are displayed with standard error of mean as error band. Averaged monthly accumulated precipitation (blue bars) is shown with standard deviation of mean as error bars. Months with average temperatures below freezing are denoted with a star. As can be seen, temperatures stay below freezing for 5 consecutive months, while only 2 months breach $10\,\unit{^\circ C}$ regularly (July, August), satisfying the conditions for K\"{o}ppens climate classification of a regular subarctic climate (Dfc). The highest monthly average temperature is $(13.1\pm 1.1)\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in July and the lowest $(-12.8\pm 2.0)\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in February. In the time period 1992--2012, the coldest measured temperature was $-45.2\,\unit{^\circ C}$ observed January 27, 1999, while the highest temperature on July 16 the same year was $29.4\,\unit{^\circ C}$.

Winter and spring (November--April, except for March) are relatively dry ($\sum_m \mathrm{Precip} < 20\,\unit{mm}$). The driest month is January with $\sum_m \mathrm{Precip} = (16.7\pm 3.0)\,\unit{mm}$. The most precipitation occurs in the summer months, with a highest monthly averaged accumulated precipitation $\sum_m \mathrm{Precip} = (58.5\pm 9.2)\,\unit{mm}$ in August. The average annual accumulated precipitation given with standard error of mean is $(383\pm 86)\,\unit{mm}$. Precipitation shows a large variability throughout the years.

A climatology derived for global irradiance $Q_0$ is shown in Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:global_rad_clim}a) for both, climatological average of hourly maximum $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{max}\right>$, minimum $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{min}\right>$, and mean $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{mean}\right>$ irradiance observed at Svanvik. In agreement with the geometrically derived sunshine duration shown in Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:sunlight_fennoscandia}, $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{max}\right>$ approaches zero in December/January commonly known as polar night and reaches its maximum in June/July commonly referred to as midnight sun conditions. The highest observed $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{max}\right>$ is about $800\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$, while on average $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{mean}\right>$ it is about $450\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$ (regularly reached in May--July). The maximum of the climatological minimum $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{min}\right>$ lies at about $200\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$.

Averaged monthly accumulated precipitation (blue bars) is shown with standard deviation of mean as error bars. Months with average temperatures below freezing are denoted with a star.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Ozone}
\label{subsubsec:clim_ozone}
In the following, we will look at derived ozone climatologies from different perspectives.
The multi-annual means of daily mean ozone, for simplicity here without standard deviations, at observation sites in northern Fennoscandia (refer to Table~\ref{tab:ebas_obs} for details) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}. All climatologies peak in spring, with peak values of about $48\,\unit{ppb}$ in late April. The annual average ozone concentration \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} declines throughout the growing season until it reaches its minimum in late summer/fall ($24-30\,\unit{ppb}$). The turning points lie approximately in June and November. The ozone climatology lags about 3 months behind the temperature climatology. At Svanvik, \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} is $6.6\,\unit{ppb}$ lower than on sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN). The large spread in case of Svanvik and Janiskoski can be explained due to the lower overall statistics.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}
  \caption{Multi-annual mean of daily mean ozone at observation sites in Fennoscandia. The large spread in case of Svanvik and Janiskoski is due to the lower statistics. All climatologies peak in spring, with peak values in April. The annual average ozone concentration \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} at Svanvik is $6.6\,\unit{ppb}$ lower than at the sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN).}
  \label{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}
\end{figure}

The correlation of \chem{[O_3]} between Esrange, Pallas, and Jergul/Karasjok is fairly high ($r^2\approx 0.8$, Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:density_distribution}a, b), hence we can put those data series together to derive a general ozone climatology for northern Fennoscandia. The correlation between Svanvik and Esrange and Pallas is rather low, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. Thus, Svanvik cannot directly be represented by any measurements taken at either Esrange or Pallas. We shall come back to this in Section~\ref{subsec:ozone_reco}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}, the 2 dimensional density distributions for the thus defined northern Fennoscandia (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}a) and Svanvik (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}b) are shown. Darker colors indicate higher probability to observe these values. On top of the density distributions, $10\,\unit{days}$ averages of daily mean \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, daily maximum \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}}, and daily minimum \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, min}} are displayed together with the $1 \sigma$ uncertainties, respectively. In addition, \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}} is also shown with standard error of mean (albeit small and hardly visible). Splines have been fitted through the data for easier inter-comparison with reanalysis data.

From the northern Fennoscandic climatology, one can deduce several features. The maximum of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, min}} peaks about $20\,\unit{days}$ earlier than the \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, and \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}}. With respect to the periodicity of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, it takes about $7.5\,\unit{months}$ from minimum concentration to maximum concentration, while from maximum to minimum it only takes about $4.5\,\unit{months}$. The maximum of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}} is at $52\,\unit{ppb}$ in late April and the minimum of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, min}} occurs at $15\,\unit{ppb}$ in the beginning of September. The steep rise of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}} in spring is in coincidence with increasing temperatures as well as increase in global irradiance. The decrease in \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}} begins about one month ahead of the estimated onset of the greening season. Based on data from SeNorge.no and the agricultural rule of thumb that the daily average temperature has to be above $5\,\unit{^\circ C}$ for $5\,\unit{days}$ consecutively, we find $\left<G_\mathrm{begin}\right> = (150 \pm 14)\,\unit{days of the year}$ at Svanvik (Appendix Fig~\ref{fig:greening_season_change_Svanvik}), which translates into the end of May. This finding is in line with more extensive studies \citep[][e.g.,]{IJB:Karlsen2007,AFM:Linderholm}.

The density distribution for Svanvik and the respective \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, and \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}} (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}b) display a similar pattern as the northern Fennoscandic climatology. The spring peak apparently occurs slightly earlier (in the beginning of April). As Svanvik is located at lower altitude than the other sites, the earlier ozone peak may point to an interplay with ozone uptake by vegetation. {\bf TODO: The data from SeNorge seems to point to a later onset of greening, than what I interfered from OpenIFS data. This means that the beginning of the growing season is not a good measure for the termination of the ozone spring peak. This does not exclude the early start of pine forest photosynthesis as a driver. Coniferous forest starts to photosynthesis earlier than what the growing season begin would mark. \chem{CO_2} uptake and phenology of coniferous trees \citep{TB:Kolari2007} starts as early as doy 100, acclimates to leaf temperature history - photosynthesis drops at around doy 200--250.} The average ozone concentration at Svanvik is lower than at the other sites, as already mentioned, which is in league with a decrease in tropospheric ozone with decreasing altitude. In July--September, ozone is occasionally almost completely depleted during night time.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}
  \caption{Derivation of ozone climatologies. Density distributions are shown together with multi-annual mean of daily ozone concentrations \chem{[O_3]}. Splines have been fitted though daily mean and max \chem{[O_3]}. The climatology of daily mean ozone is shown together with $1\,\sigma$ standard deviation and standard error of the mean. Since \chem{[O_3]} are strongly correlated for sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN) (see Fig.~\ref{fig:density_distribution}), data of these have been averaged together to derive a climatology for northern Fennoscandia. (a) Northern Fennoscandia; (b) Svanvik.}
  \label{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}
\end{figure}

Finally, we shall look at the comparison of climatologies derived from observational ozone data and the various reanalysis products (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}). As representative for the sites, the nearest neighboring grid point has been chosen. The ECMWF products do not reproduce observed surface ozone well. The MACC reanalysis (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}a) is in general too low ($(9\pm 7)\,\unit{ppb}$) and displays an erroneous seasonal cycle. Ozone concentrations peak already in March followed by a second peak in July. Also CAMSRA matches the observed ozone climatology poorly (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}b). Despite displaying only one ozone peak, it still does not reproduce the seasonality in northern Fennoscandia well. The CAMSRA spring peak appears to lag behind by $1\,\unit{month}$ and is $5\,\unit{ppb}$ lower, whereas the minimum occurs in January compared to August/September. The annual amplitude ($(26\pm 1)\,\unit{ppb}$) is larger than in the climatology derived from observations ($19\,\unit{ppb}$). Modeled \chem{[O_3]} at Svanvik are even slightly higher than at Pallas. In contrast, the ensemble mean of the Copernicus regional model reanalysis does reproduce the seasonal cycle in northern Fennoscandia quite well (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}c), but is on average still slightly too low ($(2.8\pm 0.5)\,\unit{ppb}$).

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{ozone_climatologies_portrait}
  \caption{Comparison of climatologies derived from observational data (EBAS, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}) with various ozone reanalysis products: (a) ECMWF: MACC reanalysis; (b) ECMWF: CAMS reanalysis; (c) Copernicus: Regional model reanalysis ensemble mean. As representative for the sites, the nearest neighboring grid point has been chosen. The ECMWF products do not reproduce observed surface ozone well. The MACC reanalysis is in general too low and displays an erroneous seasonal cycle. The CAMS reanalysis matches better but does not reproduce the seasonality in northern Fennoscandia. The ensemble mean of the Copernicus regional model reanalysis does reproduce the seasonal cycle in northern Fennoscandia, though the modeled ozone concentrations are slightly too low.}
  \label{fig:ozone_climatologies}
\end{figure}

There are many probable explanations for the discovered differences in the climatologies derived from the three reanalyses. The effective changes from the MACC reanalysis to CAMSRA have been reported and discussed by \citet{ACP:Inness2019} on a global level. Amongst others, an assimilation of ozone profiles from satellite retrieval and an upgraded ozone chemistry scheme have lead to the enhanced performance of latter. The higher spatial resolution of the regional air quality models used in the CAMS Regional Ensemble compared to the global reanalyses does capture more localized depletion and peak episodes in \chem{[O_3]} better and enhances the capability of the models with respect to daily and seasonal cycles in ozone. Latter is, of course, also affected by upgrades in the OpenIFS used as meteorological forcing. However, we can assume that the main driver for the strikingly different results are the assimilated observational ozone data. Satellite retrievals resolve \chem{[O_3]} at the surface rather poorly and hence do not constrain the global models well enough \citet{ACP:Andersson2017}.

\subsection{2018/19 anomalies}
\label{subsec:anomalies}
Using these established climatologies, we look at the anomalies in 2018/19 and discuss the differences between the two years. 

\subsubsection{Temperature, precipitation, and global irradiance}
\label{subsubsec:anomal_tpq}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:plot_temperature_anomalies_svanvik}, temperature anomalies at Svanvik are shown as percentage of days warmer/colder than $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are displayed as negative percentage. The full annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). The summer of 2018 was significantly warmer than average. Especially in May and July more than $40\,\unit{\%}$ of days were significantly warmer than normal temperature. Temperatures continued to be significantly warmer throughout fall into early winter (August--November) with the exception of October. March 2018 was unusually cold. The summer of 2019 was fairly average, however significantly colder in July, while August was both significantly colder and warmer. Temperatures in April were significantly warmer than average.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{temperature_signific_1}
  \caption{Temperature anomalies at Svanvik. Percentage of days warmer/colder than $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from climatological mean displayed for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are shown as negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). The summer of 2018 was significantly warmer than average, especially May and July. The summer of 2019 was fairly average but significantly warmer than average in April and colder in July/August.}
  \label{fig:plot_temperature_anomalies_svanvik}
\end{figure}

In a similar way, the precipitation anomalies at Svanvik are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:plot_precipitation_anomalies_svanvik}. However, the percentage of days wetter/drier than $\pm \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean is shown for each month, due to the larger variability in observed precipitation too few days showed a significance of $1 \sigma$ or higher. As above, negative deviations from the climatology are shown as negative percentage and annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners. The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above $\pm\frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($30.8\,\unit{\%}$). Unlike for the temperature anomalies, the picture is not as clear. While March 2018 was unusually wet, summer and fall (May/July, September/October) were significantly drier than average. 2019 was rather average throughout the year, with drier than usual fall (September/October) and a wet December.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{precipitation_signific_1}
  \caption{Precipitation anomalies at Svanvik. Percentage of days wetter/drier than $\pm \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ from climatological mean displayed for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are shown as negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above $\pm\frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($30.8\,\unit{\%}$). Summer was significantly dry only in 2018, while fall was significantly dry in both years.}
  \label{fig:plot_precipitation_anomalies_svanvik}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the global irradiance anomalies at Svanvik are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:global_rad_signific}. The percentage of days above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean is displayed for each month. The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed. In summer 2018 (May/July), global irradiance was significantly higher than on average, while 2019 was generally an average year with a slightly darker spring (April/May).

  \caption{Global irradiance anomalies at Svanvik. Percentage of days above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from climatological mean displayed for each month.

The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). In summer 2018 (May/July), global irradiance was significantly higher than on average, while 2019 had significantly less than normal irradiance in April/May and more in June.}
  \label{fig:global_rad_signific}
\end{figure}

In summary, 2018 was significantly warmer, drier, and lighter than the climatological average, while 2019 was a rather average year.

\subsubsection{Ozone}
\label{subsubsec:anomal_ozone}
As we discussed in the preceding Section~\ref{subsubsec:anomal_tpq}, meteorological conditions in 2018 were significantly different from the climatological average. How does this translate into observed ozone anomalies \chem{\Delta[O_3]}?

If the data collected at Svanvik had been complete in 2018 and the climatology had extended into the resent past, we could have assessed the significance of ozone anomalies in the same way as for temperature, precipitation, and global irradiance. In Section~\ref{subsubsec:clim_ozone}, we described the construction of climatologies for northern Fennoscandia based on long term observations at Esrange, Jergul/Karasjok, and Pallas. For Svanvik this assessment is based on rather uncertain observations from 1986--1996. We also discussed the general patterns, similarities and differences. We shall now investigate \chem{\Delta[O_3]} in 2018/19 with respect to these climatologies in more detail.

In the following, we will use the interchangeable terms anomalies and residuals to distinguish between a climatological (anomalies) and a statistical (residuals) point of view.
All the above factors make it necessary to look not only at anomalies but statistically assess ozone concentration residuals at Svanvik as well as at Esrange and Pallas in comparison. Since the climatology of latter is more reliable, we will start with surface ozone concentration residuals \chem{\Delta[O_3]} at Esrange and Pallas in 2018. As data for 2019 has not yet been available from EBAS (last access, February 2020), we refrain from looking into these.

In Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_residuals}, the probability density functions of daily mean ozone concentration residuals for Esrange and Pallas are shown. Both stations display a clear deviation from the climatological mean, however, not significant. On average, \chem{[O_3]} had been elevated by $(1.9\pm 5.7)\,\unit{ppb}$ and $(1.9\pm 5.4)\,\unit{ppb}$, respectively. Both distributions are slightly skewed towards positive deviations with $\frac{1}{4}$ of days (3. quantile, q3) falling above $5.8\,\unit{ppb}$ and $5.6\,\unit{ppb}$, respectively.

Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_residuals-Svanvik} displays the probability density functions of daily mean ozone concentration residuals for Svanvik based on data taken in 2018/19 with respect to the climatology derived for northern Fennoscandia (denoted NF in Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_residuals-Svanvik}a) and the climatology derived for Svanvik (Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_residuals-Svanvik}b).
As previously mentioned, \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} at Svanvik are $(6.6\pm 7.1)\,\unit{ppb}$ lower than the northern Fennoscandic climatology. For 2018 and 2019, we find $\Delta\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} = (-3.8\pm 5.6)\,\unit{ppb}$ and $\Delta\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} = (-5.2\pm 5.0)\,\unit{ppb}$, respectively. While the probability density of the residuals between the two climatologies is skewed towards negative values, the skew of 2018/19 is positive.
With respect to the climatology for Svanvik (Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_residuals-Svanvik}b), the probability density functions average for 2018/19 lies at $\Delta\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} = (2.6\pm 5.8)\,\unit{ppb}$ and $\Delta\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} = (1.2\pm 5.0)\,\unit{ppb}$, respectively.
Neither of the \chem{\Delta\left<[O_3]\right>} is significant by statistical means, but daily average ozone concentrations are slightly elevated in 2018 compared to 2019.

The \chem{\left<\Delta\left<[O_3]\right>\right>} for Svanvik in 2018 is slightly larger than for Esrange and Pallas. This could mean either that 2018 had been more exceptional at Svanvik or the derived climatology may need a correction for increased tropospheric background ozone concentration. Based on the meteorological conditions, we assume 2019 as average year which leads to a constant bias of about $1.2\,\unit{ppb}$. Daily \chem{\Delta_{present-past}\left<[O_3]\right>} from Esrange and Pallas, wherein present is defined as the average of 2010--2018 and past as the respective beginning of data taking until 1997, do not reveal a clear trend: We find for Esrange $(1.5\pm 3.1)\,\unit{ppb}$ and for Pallas $(-2.5\pm 3.7)\,\unit{ppb}$ \citep{NILU2003, BER:Ruoho-Airola2015}. Former is compatible with our assumed bias for the climatology derived for Svanvik.

To further investigate the ozone residuals, we conduct a Student's~t-test ($t = \frac{\chem{\Delta[O_3]}}{\sigma}$), assuming the same sample uncertainty $\sigma$ in both, climatology and the year in question. Results for Esrange and Pallas are shown in Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_test}. This t-test clearly shows, that at both sites the residuals are significant on the $1\sigma$ level for at least $50\,\unit{\%}$. In Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_test-Svanvik}, the test statistics for Svanvik are displayed. From Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_test-Svanvik}a), we can deduce, that the residuals between the Svanvik climatology and the northern Fennoscandic climatology are significant on the $2\sigma$ level for at least half of the data, while the residuals are less certain in 2018 and 2019. In Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_test-Svanvik}b) the same is shown for the years 2018/19 with respect to the climatology from Svanvik. We find that less than $50\,\unit{\%}$ of ozone concentration residuals are significant on the $1\sigma$ level.

In accordance to the above findings, we adjust the derived ozone climatology for Svanvik by adding a constant bias correction factor $\Delta\chem{[O_3]_\mathrm{bias-corr}} = 1.2\,\unit{ppb}$ and estimate the ozone concentration anomalies for 2018/19. In Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_signific}, the resulting percentage of days above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the bias-corrected climatological mean is displayed for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are shown as negative percentage. Note that missing bars for certain months are both due to data availability (see Section~\ref{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik} for details about the time range of data taking at Svanhovd) and anomalies not meeting the criteria of $\pm 1\sigma$ deviation from climatological mean. In April/May 2018, ozone was significantly enhanced, while 2019 was generally an average year. In both years, ozone concentrations were significantly below average in November. July 2018 has not been corrected for the missing data due to data acquisition problems. The corrected value is, however, indicated by the star (refer to Section~\ref{subsec:ozone_reco} for details of the used method for gap filling).

\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption{Ozone concentration anomalies at Svanvik. Ozone climatology has been corrected for an constant negative bias of $-1.2\,\unit{ppb}$.

The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). July 2018 has not been corrected for the missing data due to data acquisition problems. The corrected value is indicated by the star (refer to Section~\ref{subsec:ozone_reco} for details). In April/May 2018, ozone was significantly higher than on average, while 2019 was generally an average year. In both years ozone concentrations were significantly below average in November.}
  \label{fig:ozone_signific}
\end{figure}

To conclude, ozone concentrations in 2018 have been elevated compared to the respective climatologies, however, on average not significantly by statistical means. At Esrange and Pallas at least $25\,\unit{\%}$ (3.~quantile) of anomalies are significant on a $3\sigma$ level or more, while at Svanvik the 3.~quantile lies at about $2\sigma$. This means that in 2018 the stations at Esrange and Pallas saw more days with elevated ozone than was monitored at Svanvik.

\section{DO3SE modeling}
\label{sec:do3se}
To investigate which of the environmental factors lead to the observed ozone damage on clover and tobacco in 2018 in contrast to 2019, when no such damage was found on the clovers but only on the sensitive tobacco cultivar, we model the ozone uptake using the DO3SE model and give an estimate on biomass reduction due to ozone uptake.

\subsection{Model description}

{\bf TODO: Some general words about DO3SE model}


\subsection{Input data and gap filling methodology}
\label{subsec:ozone_reco}
The DO3SE model requires hourly, continuous meteorological observations. In addition to variables covered in Section~\ref{sec:data}, $2\,\unit{m}$ wind $u_\text{2m}$ and vapor pressure deficit VPD are needed. VPD has been calculated from observed $T_\text{2m}$ and relative humidity
\begin{equation}
  \text{VPD} = P_s(T) \cdot \left(1-\frac{\text{relHum}}{100}\right),
\end{equation}
with saturation vapor pressure $P_s(T)$ in \unit{hPa} derived from Arden Buck equation~\citep{JAP:Buck1981, Buck2012}.
  
The following gap filling methodology was devised for the meteorological input data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single hours of missing data were filled by taking the average of the hourly values coming before, and after, the missing value.
\item Several consecutive hours of missing data (23 or less) were filled by taking the average of the corresponding hour the day before, and the day after; and repeating this for each missing hour of data. If data was unavailable from that hour of the previous day, then only the value from the day after was used and vice versa. Interpolated values were not used in calculating averages.
\item Data gaps longer than $24\,\unit{h}$ were filled using weekly diurnal averages. i.e. an average was calculated using the corresponding hour throughout the week before and after. Interpolated values were not used in calculating averages.
\end{itemize}

Because the available reanalysis products for surface ozone have their limitations, we deem it necessary to reconstruct the missing data in 2018 for the purpose of DO3SE modeling by applying a Reynolds's decomposition of the form:
\begin{equation}
  \chem{[O_3]} = \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} + \chem{\Delta[O_3]},
  \label{eq:reynolds_decomp}
\end{equation}
with climatology \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} and anomalies \chem{\Delta[O_3]}.
The exact procedure will be described in the following.
We derive hourly climatologies for individual stations and combine Esrange/Pallas to derive a climatology for northern Fennoscandia for July (Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_reconstruction_2018_07}a). We compute temporal correlations between Svanvik and the other stations in northern Fennoscandia to estimate a time lag (Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:time_lag_correlation}. We find $3\,\unit{h}$ for Esrange and Pallas with respect to Svanvik. Due to the high correlation with Svanvik (Appendix~Fig.~\ref{fig:density_distribution}), we decide on Pallas as reference station for the reconstruction. We correct the Fennoscandic climatology for the found time lag \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_{hourly,\,t-3}} by shifting the respective time series back in time by $3\,\unit{h}$ and use it to derive a projection for Svanvik:
\begin{equation}
  X = \frac{\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_{hourly}^{Svanvik}}}{\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_{hourly,\,t-3}}}.
  \label{eq:mapping}
\end{equation}
As an intermediate step, we apply Eq.~(\ref{eq:reynolds_decomp}) to derive hourly anomalies for each station $i$
\begin{equation}
  \chem{\Delta[O_3]_{hourly}}^i = \chem{[O_3]_{hourly}}^i-\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_{hourly}},
\end{equation}
with $i \in \{\text{Esrange, Pallas, Svanvik\}}$.
In Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_reconstruction_2018_07}b), these hourly ozone concentration anomalies are shown. We also correct the ozone anomalies for Pallas for the time lag \chem{\Delta[O_3]_{hourly,\,t-3}^{Pallas}} and use the mapping function in Eq.~(\ref{eq:mapping}) to derive reconstructed anomalies for the missing values at Svanvik:
\begin{equation}
    \chem{\Delta [O_3]_{hourly}^{Svanvik,\,reco}} = \chem{\Delta[O_3]_{hourly,\,t-3}^{Pallas}} \cdot X
\end{equation}
Finally, we add the bias corrected Svanvik ozone climatology and derive a reconstructed ozone concentration time series \chem{[O_3]_{hourly}^{Svanvik,\,reco}}. In Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_reconstruction_2018_07}c), the result is shown together with the observed data and the Copernicus Regional Model Reanalysis at the nearest grid point for comparison.


\subsection{Model parameters}
A comprehensive list of model parameters used in this study can be found in Supplement~Table~S1. Start ($A_\text{start}$) and end ($A_\text{end}$) of growing season for each PFT (Norway spruce, birch, perennial grassland) are estimated as follows. Evergreen needle leaf trees are photosynthetic active already at low temperatures \citep{TB:Kolari2007}. This leads necessarily to an increase in observable net photosynthesis. Hence, we use a MODIS (Aqua/Terra) retrieved net photosynthesis product for a $1\times 1\,\unit{km}$ patch centered at Svanhovd to determine onset and end of growing season. Net photosynthesis data can be approximated by a second order polynomial function (Fig.~\ref{fig:modis_Psn}). By calculating the roots of the fitted polynomial, we derive $A_\text{start} = 122\,\unit{day~of~year}$ for 2018 and day 106 in 2019. $A_\text{end}$ amounts to day 261 and 274, respectively, and shall be used for all vegetation alike. The resulting growing season for Norway spruce in 2019 was one month longer then in 2018. For estimating $A_\text{start}$ of birch tree, we use the $5$ consecutive days above $5\,\unit{^\circ C}$ agricultural rule of thumb on gridded temperature data from SeNorge.no (Fig.~\ref{fig:greening_season_change_Svanvik}). We find 129 and 130, respectively. For perennial grassland, we assume a latency period of about $1\,\unit{month}$ after snow melt. Data for first snow-free day is taken from the weather station at Øvre Neiden in Sør-Varanger. In both years, the first snow-free day incidents with the estimated date of bud burst. As leafs of birches in northern Fennoscandia {\bf (TODO: Ane, species name :-))} are smaller than southern specimen, we have measured their dimension for the purpose of this study and find $(3.0\pm 0.5)\,\unit{cm}$. \citet[][p.~52]{NINA2004} indicate an average tree height of $13.5\,\unit{m}$ in the area. To localize leaf area index (LAI), we roughly characterize land use for the $1\times 1\,\unit{km}$ patch centered at Svanhovd from areal pictures at kartverket.no: $48\,\unit{\%}$ grassland, $32.5\,\unit{\%}$ deciduous, $12.5\,\unit{\%}$ coniferous, $2\,\unit{\%}$ urban. We normalize LAI to deciduous trees based on standard DO3SE parameterization: $f_\text{con}=5/4\cdot f_\text{dec}$, $f_\text{grass}=7/8\cdot f_\text{dec}$. With these, we re-scale the average maximum LAI from MODIS ($\left<f\right> = 2.7$). This results in 3.75, 3, and 2.625 for Norway spruce, birch, and grassland, respectively. 

As pointed out by \citet{ACP:Bueker2012}, a very important factor in deriving a proper $\mathrm{POD_y}$ is the soil texture or how much water the soil can hold. As Svanhovd is located in the bed of the Pasvik river, we assume a sandy loam texture at $60\,\unit{cm}$ depth.

{\bf TODO: Write about boreal and cold parameter sets and their justification. Write about suggested method for optimizing PFTs in a simple but physiological way based on optimizing maximum climatological mean $g_\mathrm{sto}$ and morning responds. If plants have a short growing season up north optimizing \chem{CO_2} uptake around noon (highest light intensity) and speed up opening of stomata at lower intensities (morning), additional contraint lower climatological variance?}


\subsection{POD and ozone impact}

We have modeled $\mathrm{POD_y}$ for three natural/semi-natural vegetation PFTs, birch, Norway spruce, and perennial grassland. The results are shown comprehensively in Fig.~\ref{fig:pody} as a function of day of year (doy) for March--October. A flux threshold $y=1\,\unit{nmol\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ per projected leaf area (PLA) has been chosen. \chem{[O_3]} are plotted on the same axis and scales as $G_\text{sto}^\text{leaf}$ but in units of $\unit{ppb}$.

As expected, $\mathrm{POD_y}$ is higher in 2018 than in 2019 for all PFTs. In the end of the 2018 season, Birch took up $13.1\,\unit{mmol\,m^{-2}\,PLA}$, while perennial grassland had an uptake of $4.5\,\unit{mmol\,m^{-2}\,PLA}$. The largest interannual variation is also found in Birch ($2.1\,\unit{mmol\,m^{-2}\,PLA}$) and perennial grassland ($2.6\,\unit{mmol\,m^{-2}\,PLA}$). Whereas, there is only a small difference for Norway spruce ($0.3\,\unit{mmol\,m^{-2}\,PLA}$) between the two years.

Except for perennial grassland, model integrations with climatological forcings show higher $\mathrm{POD_y}$ than 2018. This can be explained by means of non linearity in modeled stomatal conductance (Eq.~(\ref{eq:stomatal})) in Eq.~(\ref{eq:pod}). The climatology in $\mathrm{POD_y}$ therefore represents rather an ideal year for growth then a true climatology. To establish a true climatology, it would be necessary to run the DO3SE model for 10--20 years with respective observed phenology as well as meteorological and ozone forcing. 

Based on this interpretation of climatology in $\mathrm{POD_y}$, we can learn more about potential ozone damage. The time derivative $\frac{\mathrm{\Delta POD_y}}{\Delta t}$ displays very different features for each PFT and meteorological forcing. Although Norway spruce shows a low interannual variation, $\frac{\mathrm{\Delta POD_y}}{\Delta t}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_rel}) indicates an extended period of higher than average ozone uptake in spring 2018 (steep slope), while ozone uptake in June/July was anomalously low in 2019 (shallow slope) but high in fall. This is most prominently visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:pody}h) for perennial grassland, where consecutive periods of low $G_\text{sto}^\text{leaf}$ manifest in three plateaus in $\mathrm{POD_y}$ throughout the season (1: $184-198\,\unit{doy}$, 2: $209-228\,\unit{doy}$, 3: $235-240\,\unit{doy}$). An episode with anomalous high ozone in mid June ($194\,\unit{doy}$) can be identified but does not amount to unusually high ozone uptake on an annual basis.

The estimated biomass reduction in \unit{\%} due to \chem{O_3} following \citet{ICP:MappingManual2017} is shown in Table~\ref{tab:biomass_reduction}. {\bf TODO: Lisa? Add paragraph about biomass reduction to introduction?}

\conclusions[Discussion and conclusions]
\label{sec:conc} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What did we learn from the 2018/2019 seasons in terms of ozone damage in the far north?
  \item What are the main uncertainties in the tools we've used?
  \item What implications could this have for future scenarios in which 2018 conditions may occur more often?
\end{itemize}
PODY is no good measure without a damage function with higher temporal resolution than annual. This has been already pointed out by \citet{AE:Musselman2006}! Higher than normal spring uptake (weather conditions) does not amount to critical uptake on an annual basis. 
Weather and climatic conditioning of plants is more important for PODy than episodes of higher than usual ozone concentrations. Therefor high $\Delta \mathrm{POD_y} / \Delta t$ is not accounted for properly.
It is important to know the plant response functions to temperature, light, humidity/precipitation as best as possible if one wants to assess risk of damage.

Regarding the shift (earlier) and prolongation (later) of the growing season in the far north no general assessment can be made. Data show that in both 2018 and 2019 ozone uptake in early season was anomalous high in all studied PFTs. The extended growing season in 2019 might have countered higher episodic ozone uptake in 2018. In both years, low mid-season uptake due to weather conditions washed out any effect of these.

Bigger picture:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ozone damage assessment using mapping manual "compromise" parameterization.
\item Land-atmosphere modelling: Problems in productivity of species especially in the arctic regions due to PFTs which are not suited for the climate. Automating optimization of climate adaption of general PFTs.

  \caption{Estimated begin (BGS) and end (EGS) of growing season for coniferous trees from MODIS Aqua/Terra net photosynthesis (PSN) product. A $1\times 1\,\unit{km}$ area around Svanhovd was selected. Daily averaged data for both 2018 and 2019 has been fitted with a quadratic polynomial function. The numerically computed root yields: BGS 122/106 day of year (doy) and EGS 261/274 day of year for 2018/2019, respectively.}

\noappendix       %% use this to mark the end of the appendix section. Otherwise the figures might be numbered incorrectly (e.g. 10 instead of 1).

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

%\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures


%\noappendix

%\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
