\begin{abstract}
  The unique vegetation of the subarctic region acclimatized to extremes of cold and midnight sun are likely to be at threat from the combined impacts of climate change and increasing ozone concentrations \chem{[O_3]}. The atmospheric and climatic characteristics of the subarctic are known to lead to pronounced peak \chem{[O_3]} in spring. To date, only a few studies assessed the response of subarctic vegetation to variations in climate and air pollution. This study looks to fill this knowledge gap by examining the uncertainty in risk assessments that are using more general boreal paramterizations. With no bespoke parameterization of stomatal response of subarctic vegetation to essential climate variables available, we propose an adjustment of existing, Boreal parameterizations, based on local climate condition. To this end, we vary temperature response functions according to the climatological temperature distribution within the growing season at our site. We evaluate the extent to which two recent years (2018 and 2019) deviate from climatic and \chem{[O_3]} norms and how these potentially more frequent future deviations may influence the projected ozone damage to subarctic vegetation. We find that 2018 was an anomalously warm and less cloudy year, particularly in spring and early summer. Higher than average \chem{[O_3]} was observed in April/May while frequent episodes of ozone volume mixing ratios (VMRs) above $40\,\unit{ppb}$ occurred in June--August. These episodes are in part attributable to forest fires in the Northern Hemisphere and warmer and sunnier conditions. We apply the integrated flux-metric Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD) to determine ozone risk and damage to vegetation as a function of \chem{[O_3]}, key environmental variables, and species-specific physiology. Our study suggests that using standard boreal parameterizations in assessments likely leads to underestimating the risk of ozone damage in this region. We find that local climate adjusted parameterizations of plant functional types (PFTs) for subarctic vegetation result in an ozone-induced biomass loss of $2.5$ to $17.4\,\unit{\%}$. For some species, this loss is up to $xx\,\unit{\%}$ larger than projected from standard boreal parameterizations used in general assessments. Efforts should be targeted towards accurately defining subarctic vegetations' physiological response to essential climate variables.

\label{sec:intro}

Ground-level ozone (\chem{O_3}) is a highly toxic pollutant known to cause damage to a variety of ecosystems around the World \citep{PT:Emberson2020}. Ozone causes reduced photosynthesis, visible foliar injury, early senescence, and programmed cell death of plants \citep{PCE:Kangasjarvi2005}. Hence affecting the global carbon cycle \citep{BGS:Lombardozzi2013} and crop yields. Annual global yield losses of four major crops (wheat, rice, maize, and soybean) of $3-15\,\unit{\%}$ have been reported \citep{PJ:Ainsworth2017} and a suggested loss in primary production in forestry of $7\,\unit{\%}$ \citep{GCB:Wittig2009,EP:Matyssek2012} has been attributed to ozone. Even though long-term (pre-1950) observations of ground-level ozone concentrations are scarce; evidence from trend analysis of those few sites suggests that since the industrial revolution, background concentrations in the northern hemisphere have at least doubled and continued to increase \citep{IPCC2013} until recently. Recent trend analyses for Europe indicate that a maximum was reached in 2007 \citep{AE:Derwent2018}, after which tropospheric background ozone started to level off or even decline \citep{ESA:Cooper2014, ACP:Wespes2018,ESA:Gaudel2018}. This can be attributed to a successful implementation of air quality regulations coupled with economic restructuring, reducing the number of episodes of peak concentrations especially in summertime \citep[e.g.,][]{ESA:Fleming2018, ESA:Mills2018}. However, changes in environmental conditions associated with climate change, such as an increase in the frequency of heatwaves, could negate the effectiveness of emission reductions concerning ozone impacts and air quality \citep{NCC:Lin2020}. Tropospheric background ozone concentrations derived from satellite instruments range between $50-65\,\unit{ppb}$ over Fennoscandia but strongly depend on season \citep{ESA:Cooper2014}.

In the annual cycle, a distinct maximum of ground-level ozone concentrations typically occurs in spring followed by lower concentrations throughout the summer. This ozone spring peak is more pronounced in northern Fennoscandia than in more southern locations but shows a high interannual variability \citep{AB:Klingberg2009, BER:Klingberg2019}. \citet{ACP:Andersson2017} showed in a modeling study focused on Fennoscandia that the variability of ozone concentrations in winter can be mainly attributed to changes in atmospheric background (transport) of ozone, while summertime abundance is mostly affected by emissions of precursors in the rest of Europe.

The precursor gases involved in the formation of ground-level ozone are carbon monoxide (\chem{CO}) and hydrocarbons known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (\chem{NO_x}). In northern Fennoscandia, episodes of elevated summertime ozone concentrations in 2003 and 2006 have been traced back to ozone precursor emissions related to forest fires in southern and eastern Europe, respectively \citep{AE:Lindskog2007,EP:Karlsson2013}. 
Besides VOCs from anthropogenic sources, hydrocarbons are also emitted by photosynthetically active vegetation in the form of terpenes and monoterpenes, so-called biogenic volatile substances (BVOCs) and soil. These emissions are thought to be a response to factors, such as thermal stress, defense against herbivores \citep{Ecosystems:Ghimire2021}, or even attraction of pollinators \citep{TPS:Penuelas2003}. \citet{Ecosystems:Ghimire2021} found no clear evidence that general warming would increase the BVOC emissions in subarctic vegetation, while a reduction of herbivory would decrease them by $44-72\,\%$.

The start of the growing season (GS) in northern Fennoscandia has been shifting to earlier dates in response to the general warming trend \citep[e.g.]{GCB:Menzel2006,RS:Hogda2013,IJB:Karlsen2007} and thereby converging with the period of the ozone spring peak. At the same time, the growing season is also becoming longer. A longer growing season is prolonging the time in which vegetation can accumulate an ozone dose. For natural and semi-natural vegetation that is already subject to rapid climatic changes known as Arctic amplification \citep{AMAP2012,IPCC2013}, these factors could promote a higher potential risk for northern vegetation to ozone-induced damage in the not so distant future. Recently, \citet{ESPR:Hayes2021} showed that the highest sensitivity to future \chem{[O_3]} variability is expected in summer when vegetation is most productive.

Ozone acts as oxidative stress to plants. Its main action is imposed through reactions occurring in the cell walls and cell membranes of mesophyll cells inside the leaves. Ozone enters the leaves through stomata, leaf pores that enable gas exchange, allowing the entry of \chem{CO_2} for photosynthesis and loss of \chem{H_2O} vapor via the plant transpiration stream. Stomatal aperture, and hence stomatal conductance to these gases (including ozone) will vary over the day and growing season primarily to balance \chem{CO_2} uptake against \chem{H_2O} vapor loss. The higher the stomatal conductance, the higher the potential for ozone uptake. Stomatal conductance has been empirically linked to key environmental variables such as air temperature $T$, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and soil water potential (SWP) as well as photosynthesis itself \citep[e.g.,][]{PTRS:Jarvis1976, BallBerry1987, Emberson2000, ICP:MappingManual2017}. Results from open-top chamber (OTC) experiments on downy birch (\emph{Betula pubescens}) and mountain birch (\emph{Betula pubescens toruosa}), native to subarctic regions, indicated reductions in both biomass, root:shoot ratio, and visible leaf damage under elevated ozone treatment ($\left<\chem{[O_3]}\right> = 36-54\,\unit{ppb}$) \citep{Amb:Manninen2009}. Though, Scots pine (\emph{Pinus sylvestris}) is considered to be more ozone tolerant due to an absence of visible injuries \citep{Amb:Girgzdiene2009}, \citet{Amb:Manninen2009} found chlorophyll:carotenoid ratio and polyamines reductions under elevated ozone concentrations indicating susceptibility to ozone also in these species.

To estimate the potential ozone risk, we use a flux-based metric, also referred to as the Phytotoxic Ozone Dose over a threshold y ($\mathrm{POD_y}$). Flux-based metrics, that relate the accumulated dose of ozone to vegetation damage, are biologically more relevant for risk assessments than exposure-based metrics because they can account for particular species characteristics (i.e. physiology and phenology) as well as key environmental variables that can decouple the relationship between ozone concentration, ozone uptake, and consequent damage \citep{PT:Emberson2020}. These flux-based metrics are better suited to represent the actual risk to vegetation from ozone, especially in the climatically extreme parts of Europe \citep{EP:Simpson2007,GCB:Mills2011,ICP:MappingManual2017}. But no bespoke parameterization for subarctic vegetation is available.
An estimate of the stomatal \chem{O_3} flux ($\Phi_\mathrm{sto}$) is calculated based on the assumption that the concentration of \chem{O_3} at the top of the canopy $h$ represents a reasonable estimate of the concentration at the upper surface of the laminar layer for a sunlit upper canopy leaf and key environmental variables affecting stomatal conductance. $\mathrm{POD_y}$ is then calculated according to:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{POD_y} = \int{(\Phi_\mathrm{sto}-y)\cdot \mathrm{d}t},
  \label{eq:pod}
\end{equation}
%
with the hourly averaged stomatal ozone flux $\Phi_\mathrm{sto}$ (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:flux_stomata})) and a stomatal ozone flux threshold $\mathrm{y}$ both given in units of \unit{nmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}\,\mathrm{PLA}^{-1}\,s^{-1}}. Herein PLA stands for Projected~Leaf~Area. The timestep $\mathrm{d}t$ is usually 1~hour. The flux threshold~$\mathrm{y}$ represents the detoxification potential of the plant and is typically only exceeded during daylight hours (i.e. when global radiation is above $50\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$). $\mathrm{POD_y}$ is given in \unit{mmol\,m^{-2}} integrated over the growing season.

The $\mathrm{POD_y}$ metric is currently used in risk assessments under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention to identify those locations across Europe where vegetation is at risk from ozone. This convention aims to develop an effects-based emission reduction policy that can target those ozone precursor emissions that are most influential in causing damage. To achieve this, the concept of critical levels (CLs) has been adopted and applied \citep{Maas2016}. Exceedance of the CL is used to identify those areas across Europe that would benefit from targeted Europe-wide emission reductions. Methods to estimate $\mathrm{POD_y}$ and CLs are defined by the UNECE LRTAP Convention and described in a Mapping Manual \citep[most recent version]{ICP:MappingManual2017}. The exceedance of the CL is calculated by: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{CL_{exeed}} = \mathrm{POD_y} - \mathrm{CL}.
\end{equation}
%

An application of the Mapping Manual method was made by \citet{GCB:Mills2011} where exceedance of the CL was related to observations of ozone damage to a clover bio-monitor. This study demonstrated the improved ability of flux-based metrics (in comparison to exposure-based metrics) to identify the geographical distribution of the risk of ozone damage and also showed that the ozone damage could extend into more northerly regions of Europe.

The described methods for risk assessment rely on accurate representation of plant physiological responses to key environmental variables and are most often parameterized using data for less extreme climates, i.e., temperate, continental, or Boreal climates. Parameterization for more extreme bio-geographical regions such as subarctic climates has not been performed and relies on assuming that less extreme Boreal parameterization will be applicable. It is important to understand the implications of using these in the subarctic. In our study, we explore how risk might be over- or underestimated using Boreal parameterization and explore an adjustment of temperature and light response functions based on climate data. This allows an understanding of which are the key aspects of modelled plant physiology that might determine the potential risk and also how the threat from ozone may change in the future. In addition, our results may hint a solution to solve long-standing issues of earth system models (ESM) which often lack PFTs specifically representing subarctic conditions in their land surface models and display over- or underproductivity in the Arctic \citep{GMD:Poulter2015,JAMES:Lawrence2019}.\\ 

In Section~\ref{sec:dam}, we give a brief summary of the key components and  drivers of the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model that is used to assess the ozone risk. To study the influence of selected parameters on ozone risk in the subarctic, we propose a method to localize temperature response functions based on climate data and start and end of the growing season from satellite observed gross primary productivity (GPP). For the later discussion of results, we summarize climate and weather conditions of the 2018/19 growing season at our research site in Section~\ref{sec:stats}. Results of the localization, the ozone risk modelling, and the climate perspective are presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}. In Section~\ref{sec:conc}, we discuss these results concerning prevailing conditions and give an outlook on how future assessments of pollution risk in the subarctic could be improved.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:dam}
In the following, we briefly describe the model used for assessing the ozone risk, its key components, input data, and gap filling procedure (Section~\ref{sec:do3se}). To study the impact of model parameters, we propose a method for parameter localization to a subarctic climate based on existing Boreal parameterizations and local climate conditions and estimate the start and end of the growing season from satellite derived GPP (Section~\ref{sec:localization}).

\subsection{DO3SE model}
\label{sec:do3se}
In our investigation of the ozone risk in the subarctic, we use the well established Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange ($\mathrm{DO_3SE}$) model \citep{ACP:Bueker2012} which computes estimates of the total and stomatal deposition of \chem{O_3} to selected land-cover types and plant species according to UNECE Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) methodologies for effects-based risk assessment.

\subsubsection{Model description}
\label{subsec:model_describtion}

In the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model, the stomatal flux $\Phi_\mathrm{sto}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:pod}) is a fraction of the total \chem{O_3} deposition flux. A standard resistance analogous approach \citep{AE:Wesely1989} is used to transport \chem{O_3} from the atmospheric reference height $h_0$ to the vegetated surface. The calculation of aerodynamic $R_a$ and quasi-laminar boundary layer resistance $R_b$ follow \citet{WASP:Simpson2003,ACP:Simpson2012}. The surface resistance $R_\mathrm{surf}$ consists of stomatal $r_\mathrm{sto}$ and non-stomatal canopy resistances that include external plant surfaces $r_\mathrm{ext}$, aerodynamic within-canopy $R_\mathrm{inc}$ and ground surfaces or soil resistances $R_\mathrm{gs}$ \citep{WASP:Simpson2003,ACP:Simpson2012}. Under the assumption that the ozone concentration \chem{[O_3]} at the top of the canopy represents a reasonable estimate of the concentration at the upper surface of the laminar layer for a sunlit upper canopy leaf, $r_\mathrm{sto}$ and $r_\mathrm{ext}$ are calculated per leaf/needle area (note lower case $r$).
%
\begin{equation}
  R_\mathrm{sur} = \frac{1}{\frac{\mathrm{LAI}}{r_\mathrm{sto}}+\frac{\mathrm{SAI}}{r_\mathrm{ext}}+\frac{1}{R_\mathrm{inc}+R_\mathrm{gs}}}
\end{equation}
%
Stomatal resistance $r_\mathrm{sto}$ is the inverse of stomatal conductance $g_\mathrm{sto}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:stomatal}). Accounting for these the effective stomatal flux $\Phi_\mathrm{sto}$ at the vegetation height $h$ is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_\mathrm{sto} = \chem{[O_3]}(h) \cdot g_\mathrm{sto}(h).
  \label{eq:flux_stomata}
\end{equation}
A linear gradient reducing \chem{[O_3]} from $h_0$ to $h$ was adopted in the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model based on detailed transport studies using the chemical transport model EMEP \citep{ACP:Simpson2012,ICP:MappingManual2017}.

The opening of stomata or stomatal conductance $g_\mathrm{sto}$ is governed by different species-specific factors and response to key environmental variables. In the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model, it is described by a multiplicative empirical model \citep{PTRS:Jarvis1976,Emberson2000,ICP:MappingManual2017}:
\begin{equation}
  g_\text{sto} = g_\text{max} \cdot f_\text{phen} \cdot f_\text{light} \cdot \max{\left\{f_\text{min}, f_\mathrm{T} \cdot f_\mathrm{VPD} \cdot f_\text{SWP}\right\}}.
  \label{eq:stomatal}
\end{equation}
%
Where $g_\mathrm{max}$ is a species-specific maximum stomatal conductance value that is modified by factors that vary within a range of $0-1$. These factors are empirically determined and account for leaf phenology ($f_\text{phen}$), light ($f_\text{light}$), temperature ($f_\mathrm{T}$), water vapor pressure deficit ($f_\mathrm{VPD}$), and soil water potential ($f_\text{SWP}$). All factors differ with plant functional type (PFT).

The leaf phenology factor ($f_\mathrm{phen}$) is a stepwise defined linear function that allows for an increase of stomatal conductance in spring (start of growing season) and a decrease in fall (end of growing season). Mid anthesis and mid season dips in stomata conductance can also be accounted for but are not relevant in the subarctic. 

The temperature response function is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  f_\mathrm{T} = \frac{T_\text{air}-T_\text{min}}{T_\text{opt}-T_\text{min}} \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{max}}-T_\text{air}}{T_{\text{max}}-T_\text{opt}}\right)^\beta,
  \label{eq:f_temp}
\end{equation}
with $\beta = \frac{T_\text{max}-T_\text{opt}}{T_\text{opt}-T_\text{min}}$ a mixed reciprocal polynomial function of temperature. The shape parameters $T_\text{min}$, $T_\text{max}$ and $T_\text{opt}$ are tabulated for various PFT and $T_\mathrm{air}$ is the near-surface air temperature. All temperatures are defined in units of \unit{^\circ C}.

The water vapor pressure deficit function is
%
\begin{equation}
  f_\mathrm{VPD} = f_\text{min}+(1-f_\text{min}) \cdot \frac{D_\text{min} - \text{VPD}}{D_\text{min}-D_\text{max}}
  \label{eq:f_vpd}
\end{equation}
%
where VPD is the leaf to air vapor pressure deficit in \unit{kPa} with a minimum conductance $f_\text{min}$. $D_\text{min}$, $D_\text{max}$ describe the relative stomatal conductance to changes in vapor pressure deficit.

The light response function $f_\mathrm{light}$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{light} = 1-\text{exp}(-\alpha_\text{light}\cdot \text{PPFD})
  \label{eq:flight}
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha_\mathrm{light}$ is a slope parameter describing the extent of stomatal opening at low light intensities. The wavelength band $400-700\,\unit{nm}$ to which plant chlorophyll responds to is called photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Its integral is the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).

In the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model, Soil Water Potential (SWP) across a PFT specific root depth is simulated according to the Penman--Monteith energy balance method that drives water cycling through the soil--plant--atmosphere system \citep{ACP:Bueker2012}. The stomatal response to changes in SWP ($f_\mathrm{SWP}$) are, thus, given by:
%
\begin{equation}
  f_\mathrm{SWP} = \text{min}\left\{1, \text{max}\left\{f_\mathrm{min}, \frac{(1 - f_\mathrm{min})\cdot(\mathrm{SWP_{min}} - \mathrm{SWP})}{\mathrm{SWP_{min}} - \mathrm{SWP_{max}}} + f_\mathrm{min} \right\} \right\}
    \label{eq:fsw}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathrm{SWP_{min}}$ and $\mathrm{SWP_{max}}$ are the parameters describing the $f_\mathrm{SWP}$ relationship.

\subsubsection{Gap filling methodology}
\label{subsec:gap_filling}
The $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model requires hourly, continuous input data. Therefor, the following gap filling methodology was devised for the meteorological drivers of the model:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single hours of missing data were filled by taking the average of the hourly values before, and after, the missing value.
\item Several consecutive hours of missing data (23 or less) were filled by taking the average of the corresponding hour the day before, and the day after; and repeating this for each missing hour of data. If data were unavailable from that hour of the previous day, then only the value from the day after was used and vice versa. Interpolated values were not used in calculating averages.
\item Data gaps longer than $24\,\unit{h}$ were filled using weekly diurnal averages. i.e. an average was calculated using the corresponding hour throughout the week before and after. Interpolated values were not used in calculating averages.
\end{itemize}

To fill gaps in the ozone data, we applied the methodology described in \citet{ACP:Falk2021} that is based on a Reynolds decomposition of the form:
\begin{equation}
  \chem{[O_3]} = \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} + \chem{\Delta[O_3]},
  \label{eq:reynolds_decomp}
\end{equation}
with an ozone climatology (multiannual norm) \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} and ozone anomalies (deviation from the norm) \chem{\Delta[O_3]}. We computed a generalized climatology for northern Fennoscandia from long-term records of different close by sites and for our site. We determined the station with the highest correlation coefficient compared to our site. For this site, we calculated the anomalies with respect to the generalized climatology for the gap period. These anomalies were than added to the climatology of our site and corrected for an increase in present-day tropospheric background ozone compared to the early 1990s. For more details refer to \citet{ACP:Falk2021}.

\subsubsection{Input data and observation site}
\label{subsec:data}
The required input data consists of ozone concentration $\chem{[O_3]}$, $2\,\unit{m}$ temperature $T_\mathrm{2m}$, global irradiation $Q_0$, precipitation, $2\,\unit{m}$ wind $u_\mathrm{2m}$, and vapor pressure deficit VPD. VPD has been calculated from observed $T_\mathrm{2m}$ and relative humidity
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{VPD} = P_s(T) \cdot \left(1-\frac{\mathrm{relHum}}{100}\right),
\end{equation}
with saturation vapor pressure $P_s(T)$ in \unit{hPa} from Arden~Buck~equation~\citep{JAP:Buck1981, Buck2012}.
 
As site for our study, we chose Svanhovd in northern Norway ($69.45\,\unit{^\circ N}$, $30.03\,\unit{^\circ E}$, $30\,\unit{m\,a.s.l.}$). Reasons for our choice: (1) Ambient ozone concentration had been monitored there in the past, (2) an agrometeorological station is measuring, e.g. $2\,\unit{m}$ temperature, precipitation, global irradiance, and soil temperature at different depths, and (3) a national surveillance of air pollution (\chem{NO_x}, \chem{SO_x}, particular matter (PM), radiological species) is ongoing. Most of these measurements are performed by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), who also conducted ozone measurements on our behalf during the 2018/19 growing season. 

All essential climate variables for the 2018/19 growing season were provided by NILU through the web portal \href{luftkvalitet.no}{luftkvalitet.no} (last accessed May 2020). The ozone monitoring data have been added to a database for air-quality monitoring called EBAS as well operated by NILU and are thus openly accessible. Long-term ozone observation data (1986--1996) were obtained from EBAS. Note that data from before the 1990s do not follow the high-quality standard procedures implemented nowadays and have to be treated with care \citep{NILU2003}. Because ozone monitors did not undergo regular re-calibration drifts in the observed data occurred imposing false trends which are small but in the same order of magnitude as the expected trends in tropospheric background ozone. This does not concern the ozone seasonality which we are particularly interested in.
The long-term data sets of agrometeorological variables including temperature and precipitation are available from September 1992 to the present day \citep[LandbruksMeteorologiske Tjeneste][note the station name here is Pasvik]{LMT_NIBIO}.

To relate local ozone concentration \chem{[O_3]} with visible damage on ozone sensitive plants, an ozone bio-monitor (referred to as ozone garden) has been installed at Svanhovd in the 2018/19 GS. The locations of the atmospheric monitoring site and the ozone garden are marked in the aerial photography shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:svanhovd_research_station}a. An ozone garden consists of selected plant species that are sensitive to ozone and are likely to display visible injuries. Cultivated species were, e.g. clovers (\emph{Trifolium repens}, \emph{Trifolium pratense}), tobacco (\emph{Nicotiana tabacum}, cultivars Bel-W3, Bel-B and Bel-C), and potato (\emph{Solanum tuberosum}). As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:svanhovd_research_station}b, the plants had to be protected from herbivores with a wire-mesh fence. In 2018, we qualitatively observed visible ozone damage on semi-natural vegetation (clover) and crops (tobacco). In contrast, no such visible damage was found on the clovers in 2019, although it was observed on the sensitive tobacco cultivar (Bel-W3). Note that the extent of visible damage is not equivalent to a quantitative reduction of above/below ground biomass of a species.

\subsection{Model parameter localization}
\label{sec:localization}

We determined the dominant species on-site at Svanhovd from Fig.~\ref{fig:svanhovd_research_station}a and found perennial grassland, birch (generalized as deciduous trees), and Scots pine (generalized as coniferous trees). Basic parameters for these PFTs are derived from \citet{EP:Simpson2007,GCB:Mills2011,ICP:MappingManual2017} and will be referred to as mapping manual (MM) parameterizations. The localization of parameters for coniferous trees is based on MM's Boreal Norway spruce, deciduous trees on MM's silver birch, and perennial grassland on MM's perennial grassland for Central Europe. For a comprehensive list of MM parameters, consult Supplement~Table~S1. In the following, we suggest localizations of key environmental parameters to a subarctic climate based on meteorological data to assess over-/underestimation of ozone damage when using MM Boreal parameterizations in ozone risk assessments.

\subsubsection{Temperature and light response}

Initial simulations with the MM parameterizations for perennial grassland revealed an unexpected low stomatal conductance at leaf-level ($G_\mathrm{sto}^\mathrm{leaf}$) in 2019 (Appendix~Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_mm_composit}). Substantial stomatal conductance occurred only during an extended warm period in late July. In ecological terms, this means that there would have been almost no growth of grass in the summer of 2019 -- a model prediction that is falsified by reality. We identified $f_\mathrm{T}$ as abnormally low throughout the season, being the limiting factor of stomatal conductance in perennial grassland. This suggested that a localization of the parameterization to a subarctic climate was necessary.

To localize the temperature response function $f_\mathrm{T}$, we divided the temperature dataset into two subsets: 1992--2000 (near past) and 2011--2019 (present). From these two subsets, we selected only dates within the GS (May--September) and plotted the probability density functions (PDFs) as histograms with $1\,\unit{^\circ C}$ binning (Fig.~\ref{fig:f_temp_grassland}a). A comparison between the two PDFs indicates that the temperature distribution has shifted towards higher temperatures reducing the number of days below $5\,\unit{^\circ C}$. It is unclear how fast the species composition of perennial grassland responds to these changes. Thus, the predominant acclimation at present is not known. Further, we overlaid these histograms with the MM $f_\mathrm{T}$. A low overlapping area suggests a low agreement with local climate conditions. 

Hence, the idea was to define localized temperature response functions by increasing the overlapping area between $f_\mathrm{T}$ and the temperature PDF during the GS. To this end, we defined two different hypothetical target species: subarctic and cold. We constructed \emph{cold} as representative for a species that is more tolerant to cold temperatures than MM, but slightly less efficient at warm temperatures than MM. This was accomplished by moving $T_\mathrm{min}$ and $T_\mathrm{opt}$ towards cooler temperatures but $T_\mathrm{max}$ was kept at its MM value. In the same way, \emph{subarctic} was constructed to represent a species that is very tolerant to cold but sensitive to high temperatures, and most efficient at cool temperatures. Therefore, we shifted both $T\mathrm{min}$ and $T_\mathrm{max}$ to colder temperatures and chose $T_\mathrm{opt}$ close to the climatological mean temperature of 1992--2000. The most extreme of the two localizations compared to MM is \emph{subarctic}.

For localizing $f_\mathrm{light}$, we presumed that the opening extent of stomata at low light conditions differs in subarctic species compared to species in less extreme climates. We, therefore, adjusted the modelled light sensitivity of stomata such that the PPFD value needed to reach $50\,\unit{\%}$ opening is varied by $\pm 20\,\unit{\%}$. For this, we derive the inverse function $f_{\mathrm{light},k}^{-1}$ of Eq.~(\ref{eq:flight}) for each PFT $k$ analytically
%
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_k(f_\mathrm{light}) := f_{\mathrm{light}, k}^{-1} = -\frac{\ln(1-f_\mathrm{light})}{\alpha_k}.
  \label{eq:inverse_function}
\end{equation}
%
First, we solve Eq.~(\ref{eq:inverse_function}) for the MM default value of $\alpha_\mathrm{MM}^k$ at $0.5$ ($50\,\%$ opening)
\begin{equation}
  \gamma^k(0.5) = -\frac{\ln(0.5)}{\alpha_\mathrm{MM}^k},
  \label{eq:inverse_function_halfway}
\end{equation}
and define a variation $\gamma' = \gamma \cdot \eta$ with $\eta \in \{0.8, 1.2\}$. By solving Eq.~(\ref{eq:inverse_function}) for $\alpha$, we find $\alpha'(\gamma')$. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:f_temp_grassland}b, we show the PPFD PDF for near past and present together with the $f_\mathrm{light}$ for perennial grassland. The MM parameterization is displayed as solid line.

\label{fig:f_temp_grassland}
\end{figure}

Similarly, we defined localized $f_\mathrm{T}$ and $f_\mathrm{light}$ for coniferous and deciduous trees. The resulting response functions are shown in Appendix~Figs.~\ref{fig:f_temp_spruce} and \ref{fig:f_temp_birch}, respectively.

Coniferous trees are known to start photosynthesis as soon as the leaf temperature reaches a certain threshold \citep{TB:Kolari2007} and are, thus, already active at low air temperatures and can reach $60\,\unit{\%}$ photosynthetic activity as early as \unit{doy}~100 but cease activity in less favorable conditions \citep{TB:Kolari2007, TP:Wallin2013}. 

To determine the temperature localization for coniferous trees, we used the time series of \chem{CO_2} uptake and temperature at observation sites in southern ($\rightarrow$ \emph{cold}) and northern ($\rightarrow$ \emph{subarctic}) Finland by \citet{TB:Kolari2007}. From these, we estimated an optimal temperature interval ($10\,\unit{^\circ C}\le T_\mathrm{opt} \le 15\,\unit{^\circ C}$). The same interval was assumed for deciduous trees. For deciduous and coniferous trees refer to Appendix~Figs.~\ref{fig:f_temp_spruce}b and \ref{fig:f_temp_birch}b), respectively.

All resulting temperature response function localizations are tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:sensitivity_tests_temp} and light response function in Table~\ref{tab:sensitivity_tests_light}. In Section~\ref{subsec:res_local}, we compare relative $g_\mathrm{sto}$ for the different localizations based on the long term meteorological data.

\subsubsection{Growing season estimate}
\label{subsec:gs_est}

The accumulation of ozone dose is strongly depended on the timing and length of the GS. \citet{ICP:MappingManual2017} suggest a simple latitude model for beech, birch, and Norway spruce for the localization of GS:
%
\begin{align}
  A_\mathrm{start} &= 105 + (LAT-50\,\unit{^\circ N})\cdot 1.5\\
  A_\mathrm{end} &= 297 - (LAT-50\,\unit{^\circ N})\cdot 2
\end{align}
%
At Svanhovd, this yields $A_\mathrm{start}=135\,\unit{doy}$ and $A_\mathrm{end}=257\,\unit{doy}$. We verified these as follows.

To determine $A_\text{start}$ and $A_\text{end}$ for coniferous trees, we used a MODIS (Aqua/Terra) retrieved GPP product \citep{MODIS_PSN} on a $1\times 1\,\unit{km}$ patch centered at Svanhovd. GPP over time follows approximately a second-order polynomial function (Fig.~\ref{fig:modis_gpp}). By calculating the roots of the fitted polynomial, we found $A_\text{start}$ as \unit{doy}~122 for 2018 and \unit{doy}~106 in 2019. $A_\text{end}$ amounts to \unit{doy}~261 and 274, respectively. These $A_\mathrm{end}$ value will be used for all PFTs alike. The resulting growing season for coniferous trees in 2019 was one month longer than in 2018. For $A_\text{start}$ of deciduous trees, we use temperature-degree-days (above $5\,\unit{^\circ C}$) on gridded temperature data from SeNorge.no (Appendix~Fig.~\ref{fig:greening_season_change_Svanvik}). We found \unit{doy}~129 and 130, respectively. For both years, these dates coincide with the first snow-free day at the closest inland meteorological weather station at Øvre~Neiden (Sør-Varanger, NOR). These dates are very similar to the latitude model results. For perennial grassland, we assume a latency period of $1\,\unit{month}$ after snow-melt. This assumption is supported by observations in Rovaniemi, Finland \citep[][Supplement~Fig.~S1]{FCR:Korhonen2018}. All results are tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:sensitivity_tests_gs}.

\subsubsection{Other properties}
\label{subsec:soil}

Soil texture influences water availability and thus $\mathrm{POD_y}$ calculations in $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ \citep{ACP:Bueker2012}. The soil at Svanhovd is characterized in an ICP~Forest plot survey as gleyic cambisols according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) soil classification system and as eluviated dystric brunisol in the ICP~Forest soil classification system (V. Timmerman, personal communication, June 2020). The clay:sand:silt content is estimated to range from 12\,\%:61\,\%:27\,\% at the top layer to 16\,\%:59\,\%:25\,\% in about $1\,\unit{m}$ depth (\href{https://soilgrids.org/}{soilgrids.org}, last accessed April 2022 for location $30.0334\,\unit{^\circ E}$, $69.4549\,\unit{^\circ N}$) Within the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ soil parameterization, the sandy loam texture describes the upper $60\,\unit{cm}$, where the plant roots are found, of this soil type best. We presume that no localization of the water vapor pressure deficite $f_\mathrm{VPD}$ and soil water potential $f_\mathrm{SWP}$ response functions is necessary for our species. But acknowledge that these are very important factors in the modeling of ozone dose as pointed out by~\citet{ACP:Bueker2012}.

The quasi-laminar boundary layer resistance $R_b$ is a function of wind speed $u$ and influenced by the tree height and leaf dimensions. For comparison with MM, we collected a sample of birch (B. pubescence) leaves from the outer canopy (good light exposure) of tall trees at two sites in Finnmark. The leaves were collected late in July, thus, they were fully expanded. They were collected by hand at about $2\,\mathrm{m}$ height. As the sun is at a low elevation angle for most of the time in the growing season in this area, light exposure at the top of the tree is not expected to be different from lower leaves as long as they grow in a part of the tree that is not shadowed by other trees. At the first site (Karasjok), three leaves were collected from five adult trees each. At the second site (Svanvik), five leaves were collected from one tree. The leaves were pressed and dried before scanning for the area and shape determination through image analysis. ImageJ (\href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/}{see webpage}) was used for thresholding the images to give silhouettes of the leaves. After scaling the images, the program was used for finding the minimum Feret diameter. This measure finds the largest width of a leaf at a $90^\circ$ angle to the length of the leaf (the Feret diameter). With this method we found that the 20 leaves had a mean width of $(3.0\pm 0.5)\,\unit{cm}$ that is smaller than in the MM parameterization ($5\,\unit{cm}$, Supplement~Table~S1). 

A report by \citet[][p.~52]{NINA2004} indicates an average tree height of $13.5\,\unit{m}$ in the Svanhovd area. One Scots pine forest at Svanhovd has been studied as a part of the ICP Forest mapping. Heights were measured in 2004 when the stand was 90~years old. The mean tree height was $10.1\,\unit{m}$ and maximum height was $16.2\,\unit{m}$ (V. Timmerman, personal communication, June 2020). We used $13.5\,\unit{m}$ height for both deciduous and coniferous trees as this height is sampled from a larger and more diverse population of species.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section, we first compute the average stomatal conductance $\left<g_\mathrm{sto}\right>$ relative to $g_\mathrm{max}$ for each PFT from the long term meteorological data and compare the different localizations with MM (Section~\ref{subsec:res_local}). We use the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model to compute the ozone dose and projected biomass loss due to ozone for the two recent GS 2018/19 for each species and localization (Section~\ref{subsec:do3se_results}). Finally, we put the results into a climatological perspective (Section~\ref{subsec:climatologies}).  

\subsection{Parameter localization}
\label{subsec:res_local}

We presume that perennial vegetation will likely maximize carbon acquisition during the short subarctic growing season. Because the MM version of the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model currently does not simulate net photosynthesis $A_\mathrm{n}$, we assume a first order proportionality between $A_\mathrm{n}$ and $g_\mathrm{sto}$ \citep{GCB:Medlyn2011}. A higher average $\left<g_\mathrm{sto}\right>/g_\mathrm{max}$ ratio, thus, indicates a higher growth potential in the local climate.

To compare our localized parameterizations, we propose the following metric. From the long term of meteorological data, we select to distinct periods noon ($11\,\unit{am}-1\,\unit{pm}$ local time) and morning ($5-9\,\unit{am}$ local time). For these, we calculate the average relative stomatal conductance $\left<g_\mathrm{sto}\right>/g_\mathrm{max}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:stomatal}) and assume $f_\mathrm{SWP}=1$). We presume that $\left<g_\mathrm{sto}\right>/g_\mathrm{max}$ around noon (the highest light intensity) is a good proxy for \chem{CO_2} uptake efficiency (growth). In addition, a small deviation between noon and morning and a low standard deviation indicates higher robustness of this localization to variability in growing conditions. From left to right in Fig.~\ref{fig:javis_func_opt_mean}, results using the subarctic, cold, and MM $f_\mathrm{T}$ are shown marked by the alternating background color. Within each of these groups $f_\mathrm{light}$ categories are indicated by PPFD0.8 and PPFD1.2, respectively. The standard deviation is denoted with error bars. 

Based on these criteria, we identify \emph{subarctic}--PPFD0.8 as the parameterization with the highest score for all PFTs. The differences between the localized parameterizations and the MM are smallest for coniferous trees. This indicates that the MM Boreal parameterization is well suited also for subarctic climate at Svanhovd. For perennial grassland, the difference compared to MM is largest suggesting that the MM Central European parameterization is not appropriate in a subarctic climate.

\subsection{Implications on ozone risk assessments}
\label{subsec:do3se_results}

We have modeled $\mathrm{POD_y}$ with a flux threshold $y=1\,\unit{nmol\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ per projected leaf area (PLA) for the three natural/semi-natural vegetation types, deciduous trees, coniferous trees, and perennial grassland using the generic MM parameterization and our bespoke temperature (\emph{cold}, \emph{subarctic}) and light (PPFD0.8, PPFD1.2) parameterizations. Canopy height and leaf size are adjusted to local values in the model simulations with the bespoke growing season (GS besp.). The results displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_rel} allow for an assessment of over- or underestimation of ozone risk arising from the use of generic parameterizations established from less climatically extreme conditions.
Critical levels for reduction in biomass \citep[deciduous forest $4\,\unit{\%}$, coniferous forest $2\,\unit{\%}$, and grasslands $10\,\unit{\%}$ biomass reduction,][]{ICP:MappingManual2017,ESPR:Hayes2021} are shown as horizontal dashed lines. We identify that an increase in cold tolerance (MM $\rightarrow$ cold $\rightarrow$ subarctic) leads to higher ozone uptake in both probed years, while the usage of locally adapted GS causes a reduction. The earlier and longer GS in 2019 leads to increased ozone uptake compared to 2018 despite more episodes of elevated \chem{[O_3]} in 2018. Due to the shape of $f_\mathrm{light}$, a symmetric variation leads to an asymmetric response in $\mathrm{POD_1}$. We find that an opening of stomata at lower light intensities can cause higher sensitivity to drought conditions. Similarly, a temperature acclimation to cold or subarctic conditions can lead to an amplification of effects by droughts. 

The magnitude of these effects varies between PFTs as well as years, but the predicted ozone uptake for the bespoke temperature parameterization is always larger than for the MM parameterizations and of the same order of magnitude as the variability between the years studied here. Our bespoke temperature parameterizations suggest considerable underestimations of ozone risk for subarctic species when relying on the generic MM parameterizations.

For deciduous trees (Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_rel}a) all $\mathrm{POD_1}$ simulations exceed the CL by $5-25\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$. Deciduous trees display the largest variation of ozone uptake among all PFTs ($10-31\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$). In particular, the sensitivity to the light parameterization is pronounced. With MM GS, $\mathrm{POD_1}$ values were higher in 2018 than in 2019, throughout our analyses. However, taking the bespoke GS into account, this is reversed for the subarctic temperature acclimation. This can be explained by more favorable growing conditions in 2019. Low soil water potential reduced the $\mathrm{POD_1}$ values in 2018 in some cases when using the MM growing season, but did not or only slightly when using bespoke GS. The temperature acclimation-dependent difference in ozone uptake determined for bespoke GS ranges between $(1.4-3.6)\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ in 2018 and $(2.7-7.7)\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ in 2019. The maximum deviations determined from the $-20\,\unit{\%}$ (superscript) and $+20\,\unit{\%}$ (subscript) variation of $f_\mathrm{light}$ amount to $^{+1.6}_{-2.3}\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ for 2018 and $^{+1.9}_{-2.7}\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ for 2019. 

For coniferous trees (Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_rel}b), most simulations slightly exceed the CL ($0-10\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$). The MM Boreal Norway spruce parameterization was already well acclimated to the prevailing temperatures and therefore differs the least from our bespoke parameterizations. Taking the bespoke GS and canopy height into account, we find a higher ozone uptake in 2019 than in 2018. The overall difference determined from bespoke GS for subarctic and cold parameterizations with respect to MM range between $(0.5-1.0)\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ in 2018 and $(2.0-3.3)\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ in 2019. The maximum deviations determined from the $-20\,\unit{\%}$ (superscript) and $+20\,\unit{\%}$ (subscript) variation of $f_\mathrm{light}$ and amounts to $^{+1.0}_{-0.8}\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ for 2018 and $^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ for 2019.

For perennial grassland (Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_rel}c), all simulations with bespoke GS stay below the CL. Perennial grassland shows the smallest ozone uptake, but a similarly large response to the temperature parameterizations as deciduous trees. Again, we find a reversal for predicted ozone risk in $\mathrm{POD_1}$ between 2018 and 2019 for the subarctic type. Perennial grassland shows the lowest sensitivity to the light threshold and SWP is only relevant without bespoke GS. The overall difference determined from bespoke GS for subarctic and cold types with respect to MM ranges between $(2.2-3.4)\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ in 2018 and $(4.4-6.4)\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ in 2019. The lower maximum temperature tolerance in the subarctic compared to the cold temperature parameterization probably caused the lower $\mathrm{POD_1}$ values calculated for 2018 in subarctic compared to cold climate, whereas this was not seen for 2019. The maximum deviations determined from the $-20\,\unit{\%}$ (superscript) and $+20\,\unit{\%}$ (subscript) variation of $f_\mathrm{light}$ amount to $^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$ and $^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\,\unit{mmol\,\chem{O_3}\,m^{-2}}$, respectively.

From the difference between 2018 and 2019, we infer a substantial interannual variability. The maximum deviation from the generic default parameterizations due to our bespoke temperature and light response functions is of the same order of magnitude as the interannual variability.

We estimated the biomass reductions in accordance to the CLs \citep{ICP:MappingManual2017, ESPR:Hayes2021} for the most extreme temperature parameterization (\emph{subarctic}) for each bespoke PFT. The estimates are listed in Table~\ref{tab:biomass_reduction}. The reported range corresponds to the maximum deviation defined by the $\pm 20\,\unit{\%}$ variation of $f_\mathrm{light}$ with SWP=on. The total biomass of deciduous trees and perennial grassland was substantially reduced in comparison with the default MM parameterizations in both years. The CL for perennial grassland is higher than for the other species. From an agro-economical point of view in our focus area, where the grass is cut only once a year, a loss of biomass of more than $10\,\unit{\%}$ can have severer consequences compared to more productive areas in central Europe and may need adjustment.

Coniferous trees are the least affected and the magnitude of total biomass reduction is almost independent of the choice of the parameterization within given uncertainties. This may reflect that the temperature parameterization in the MM is rarely a limiting factor for stomatal opening.

\subsection{Climate and weather conditions}
\label{sec:stats}
Here, we put the conditions during the growing season 2018/19 into a climatological context.

\subsubsection{Weather conditions in the growing season 2018/19}
\label{subsec:weather}

All relevant data for the growing season 2018/19 are shown as time series in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}. Ozone concentrations measured at $2\,\unit{m}$ height above ground are averaged hourly. The hatched areas mark times when no ozone data were recorded. Note, while the downtime during winter was planned, missing data in two weeks of July 2018 (July 9--23) were due to problems in data acquisition.

As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}a, \chem{[O_3]} peaks in spring (April/May) and reaches its minimum in late summer (July/August). The spring peak has not been captured completely in 2019, since data acquisition only started in late April. In summer 2018 (June--August), high ozone concentrations ($\chem{[O_3]} > 40\,\unit{ppb}$) were recorded 50 times. The highest summer ozone concentration ($\chem{[O_3]} = 50.2\,\unit{ppb}$) was measured on July 25. This coincides with the period of the most extensive forest fires in central Sweden which occurred from July 12--29 \citep{SOU2019}. However, due to the above-mentioned data acquisition problems, we missed most of the corresponding ozone data for this event and most likely also the peak \chem{[O_3]}. A method for gap-filling these data has been presented in \citet{ACP:Falk2021}. In contrast, \chem{[O_3]} only rose 18 times above the threshold of $40\,\unit{ppb}$ during the summer of 2019. 

Hourly averaged $2\,\unit{m}$ temperatures above $20\,\unit{^\circ C}$ occurred more regularly in July 2018 than in 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}b). In 2018, spring temperature regularly rose above freezing only in May, while in 2019 this occurred already early in March/April.
More rain events with accumulated daily precipitation ($\sum_d \mathrm{Precip}$) above $10\,\unit{mm}$ occurred in the summer of 2018 compared to 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}c).
Qualitatively, global irradiance ($Q_0$) displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}d was higher in May and July 2018 compared to 2019, while June 2019 showed higher irradiance than in 2018. A high global irradiance, in most cases, is the result of a low cloud fraction. In both years, the maximum recorded $Q_0$ was $750\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$ and reached in June.

  \label{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Climate (1990-present)}
\label{subsec:climatologies}

Climatologies of temperature and precipitation for Svanhovd were derived for the period 1992--2012 and are shown in a combined climate diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:climatediagram}). Monthly averaged $2\,\unit{m}$ temperatures (red line) are displayed with a standard deviation as error band. Averaged monthly accumulated precipitation (blue bars) is shown without standard deviation. Months with average temperatures below freezing are denoted with a star. As can be seen, temperatures stay below freezing for 5 consecutive months, while only 2 months breach $10\,\unit{^\circ C}$ regularly (July, August), satisfying the conditions for K\"{o}ppen's climate classification of a regular subarctic climate (Dfc) \citep[e.g.][]{SD:Beck2018}. The highest monthly average temperature is $(13.1\pm 1.1)\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in July and the lowest $(-12.8\pm 2.0)\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in February. The coldest measured temperature was $-45.2\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in January 27, 1999, while the highest temperature ($29.4\,\unit{^\circ C}$) occurred on July 16 the same year.

\begin{figure*}[t]

  %\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig04}
  \caption{Climate diagram based on meteorological data for Svanvik/Pasvik (1992--2012). Ozone climatology based on ozone monitoring data at NIBIO Environment Centre Svanhovd(1986--2003).

Notches indicate the confidence interval around the median. (a) Temperature; (b) accumulated precipitation; (c) radiant energy; (d) ozone VMR}
  \label{fig:climatediagram}
\end{figure*}

The average accumulated monthly precipitation ($\sum_d\mathrm{Precip}$) indicates that winter and spring (November--April, except for March) are relatively dry ($\sum_d\mathrm{Precip} < 20\,\unit{mm}$). March precipitation is primarily snow and will influence the start of the growing season. The driest month is January with $\sum_d\mathrm{Precip} = (16.7\pm 3.0)\,\unit{mm}$. The most precipitation occurs in the summer months, with a $\sum_d\mathrm{Precip} = (58.5\pm 9.2)\,\unit{mm}$ in August. The average annual accumulated precipitation ($\sum_m\mathrm{Precip}$) given with standard error of mean is $(383\pm 86)\,\unit{mm}$. Precipitation shows a considerable interannual variability.

The climatology for global irradiance ($Q_0$, not shown) approaches zero in December/January (polar night) and reaches its maximum in June/July (midnight sun conditions). We determine the corresponding highest $Q_0$ to $800\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$. The maximum of the lowest $Q_0$ (including night) amounts to $200\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$ indicating that a considerable amount of light is available under midnight sun conditions.

%Ozone
The daily mean ozone climatology (\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>}) (1986--1996) is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:climatediagram}d. Darker colors indicate higher probability to observe these values. On top of the density distributions, a $10\,\unit{days}$ average of daily mean (\chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}}}) is displayed together with $1 \sigma$ uncertainties and SE, respectively. A spline was fitted through the data to guide the eye. The \chem{[O_3]} density distribution and the \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}}} display the expected, pronounced seasonal cycle. The spring peak occurs on average on day of the year (\unit{doy}) $100$ and amounts to $40\,\unit{ppb}$ while the annual average \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} is $28\,\unit{ppb}$. The decline in \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} coincides with the average beginning of \chem{CO_2} uptake by coniferous trees \citep{TB:Kolari2007, TP:Wallin2013}. In July--September (\unit{doy}~182--273), ozone is occasionally almost completely depleted. This hints to ozone uptake by vegetation even at low light intensities during midnight sun conditions in combination with stable planetary boundary layer conditions preventing mixing of ozone rich air.

\subsection{2018/19 growing season anomalies}
\label{subsec:anomalies}
In the following, we look at the 2018/19 anomalies and discuss the differences between the two years. As weather extremes like in 2018 are likely to become more frequent with climate change, this will help to assess possible future changes in the vulnerability of subarctic vegetation to ozone.\\ 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:anomalies_svanvik}a, temperature anomalies for Svanvik are shown as a percentage of days warmer or colder than $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the climatology for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are displayed as a negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). We find, that the summer of 2018 was significantly warmer than average. Especially in May and July more than $40\,\unit{\%}$ of the days were significantly warmer. A significant number of warmer days continued to occur in all months (August--November) except for October. March 2018 had many unusually cold days. The summer of 2019 was fairly average, however, more significantly colder days occurred in July, while August had both significantly colder and warmer days. April 2019 had significantly warmer than average days.

\begin{figure*}[t]

  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{anomalies}
  \caption{2018/19 anomalies of key environmental variables at Svanhovd displayed as difference from median for each month. The hatched area between indicates the IQR. (a) Temperature; (b) precipitation; (c) radiant energy; (d) ozone VMR.}
  \label{fig:anomalies_svanvik}
\end{figure*}

Similarly, the precipitation anomalies for Svanvik are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:anomalies_svanvik}b. Due to the large interannual variability in observed precipitation, only a few days deviated significantly from the climatology on the $1 \sigma$ level. Therefore, we lowered the $\sigma$ level constraint to $\pm \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$. The percentage of days wetter/drier than $\pm \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ are shown for each month. Positive deviation refers to days wetter than average and negative deviation to drier than average. The hatched area between the dashed lines indicates the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm\frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($30.8\,\unit{\%}$). Unlike the temperature anomalies, the picture is not as clear. While March 2018 had a significant number of days wetter than usual, summer and fall (May/July, September/October) had a significant number of days drier than average. 2019 was rather average throughout the year, but with a significant number of days drier than normal in September/October and wetter in December.

The global irradiance anomalies for Svanvik are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:anomalies_svanvik}c. The percentage of days above or below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean is displayed for each month. In summer 2018 (May/July), global irradiance showed a significant number of days with higher than average irradiance, while 2019 was generally an average year with a significant number of days darker in spring (April/May).

%Ozone
We use the bias-corrected and cross-calibrated ozone climatology \citep{ACP:Falk2021} and assess the monthly significance of the ozone concentration anomalies in 2018/19. The resulting percentage of days above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ is displayed for each month in Fig.~\ref{fig:anomalies_svanvik}d. Note that missing bars for months in winter and spring are both due to the temporal extent of our data and anomalies not meeting the $1\sigma$ criteria. The star indicates the reconstructed data in July. In April/May 2018, ozone was significantly elevated, while no significant enhancement is found in 2019. In both years, ozone concentrations were significantly lower than average in November. These results suggest that stagnant meteorological conditions in April/May in combination with a late start of the growing season contributed more to elevated ozone than the extensive forest fires in Sweden that did not significantly enhance \chem{[O_3]} in 2018.

In summary, 2018 had a significant number of days that were warmer, drier, and brighter than the climatology, while 2019 was a rather average year. Ozone was not significantly enhanced during the GS 2018/19, but a substantially higher number of peak \chem{[O_3]} were observed in 2018 than in 2019.


\conclusions[Discussion and conclusions]
\label{sec:conc}

For our study, we conducted a similar bio-monitoring study at Svanhovd, a site with agrometeorological and air pollution monitoring, to assess whether local ozone concentrations were capable of inducing damage to vegetation growing under northern Fennoscandia conditions. In 2018, we indeed observed ozone damage on clover and tobacco. In contrast, no such damage was found on the clovers in 2019. This indicates that key environmental variables in 2018 differed from 2019.

According to a report by the Norwegian Meteorological institute \citep{MetNOR2019}, the summer of 2018 was the warmest and driest ever recorded in eastern, western, and southern Norway. In the north (including Finnmark), it was amongst the warmest on record -- favorable conditions for ground-level ozone formation.
An unusually weak and northward shifted jet stream allowed for a persistent high-pressure system above northern Europe, including Fennoscandia which blocked the low-pressure systems for several consecutive months. In the period May -- July, southern Norway experienced temperatures $4\,\unit{^\circ C}$ above normal and saw only about $60\,\unit{\%}$ of normal precipitation. Northern Norway as a whole had close to normal precipitation, one of the causes of the high rate of forest fires in that area.
Thermal stress on vegetation was exceptional not only in large parts of Fennoscandia but also in much of Europe, where the influence of the high-pressure system extended even over five months (April/May, July--September). These conditions gave rise to massive forest fires in different parts of Europe and thus an increase in ozone precursors.
A total of 2079 forest fires were registered in Norway in 2018, twice as many as in the preceding years 2016/17 \citep{DSB2019}, last accessed April 2020). In Sweden, about 500 fires had been reported (five times more than in a usual summer), and an estimated total of $25000\,\unit{hectare}$ burned down in central Sweden (G\"{a}vleborgs, J\"{a}mtlands, and Dalarnas l\"{a}n) \citep{SOU2019}. Boreal wildfires are found to emit ozone precursors \chem{CO} ($\chem{[CO]}/\chem{[CO_2]} \propto 6-13\,\unit{\%}$) and VOCs ($\chem{[VOCs]}/\chem{[CO_2]} \propto 0.5-1.5\,\unit{\%}$) \citep{AE:Cofer1990}. Coincident peak \chem{[O_3]} is found in ozone monitoring data (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}) in July. It is very likely that elevated ozone, like during the 2003 drought period \citep{JGR:Solberg2018}, was promoted by a combination of various factors such as wildfires, reduced cloud cover (increased solar radiation), reduced dry deposition and turbulent mixing due to the stagnant weather conditions, and increased BVOC emissions. As such events may become more frequent in the future, conditions at Svanhovd for the growing seasons 2018 shall serve as a reference for probable future conditions in northern Fennoscandia. Conditions in 2019 represent the present climate.\\


To summarize, we have developed bespoke parameterizations of common vegetation types (coniferous and deciduous trees, perennial grassland) to a subarctic climate and studied their effect on $\mathrm{POD_y}$. The comparison between meteorological conditions in 2018 and 2019 and their divergence from climatology allowed us to assess the influence of key environmental variables such as temperature, PPFD, and precipitation on vegetation susceptibility to \chem{O_3} damage in light of future changes as may occur under climate change. We found that conditions for ozone formation were more favorable in the 2018 growing season than in 2019, with 2018 being significantly warmer and less cloudy in spring and early summer. Accordingly, peak ozone concentrations occurred more frequently and at higher levels in 2018. This was particularly a result of the extended heatwave in spring and early summer and associated, extensive wildfires in Central Sweden. However, ozone concentrations during the growing season were not significantly enhanced and \chem{POD_1} values were very similar for both years.
This suggests that the overall length of the growing season is more crucial in risk assessment when using flux-based metrics than episodes of peak concentrations as these peak \chem{[O_3]} often coincide with environmental conditions that limit ozone uptake in the $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ model.

Based on a MODIS photosynthesis product \citep{MODIS_PSN}, we estimated the growing season for coniferous trees in 2018 to be at least one month shorter than in 2019. The determined start of growing season in 2018 ($\unit{doy}~122$) and 2019 ($\unit{doy}~106$) lies within the range given by observations in Fennoscandia \citep{TB:Kolari2007,IVL:Karlsson2018}. We determined the start of the growing season for deciduous trees based on gridded observational temperature and for perennial grassland on snow depth data. For perennial grassland, we assumed an one-month latency period after snowmelt that is supported by observational data from Rovaniemi (Finland) \citep{FCR:Korhonen2018}. With respect to ongoing climate change, a clear positive trend emerged in length ($5.2\,\unit{d\,decade^{-1}}$) of the growing season that is almost equally distributed between earlier start ($2.9\,\unit{days\,decade^{-1}}$) and later end ($2.3\,\unit{d\,decade^{-1}}$) (Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:greening_season_change_Svanvik}).

 The $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ modeling results are in contrast to our observation of more visible damage in 2018 compared to 2019. However, visible damage caused by peak ozone uptake and dependence of ozone sensibility on phenology are not accounted for in $\mathrm{POD_y}$. In this regard, open-top chamber (OTC) experiments performed in northern Finland where Scots pine and downy birch seedlings were exposed to elevated ozone concentrations attributed a reduction in biomass and reproduction with visible damage explicitly to peak \chem{O_3} concentrations and fast phenological development at high growth rate \citep{Amb:Manninen2009}. In particular, forbs and perennial grassland are more susceptible to ozone-induced damage in the reproductive state \citep{EP:Bassin2004}. 
That might explain why we observed damage in the ozone garden to a larger extent in 2018 than in 2019. An associated damage function to ozone depending on leaf age as proposed by \citet{AE:Musselman2006} or phenological state might improve the predictions.

At the same time, intra-species variability even at the same location is typically non-negligible \citep{EP:Bassin2004} but not accounted for in the models. The literature results regarding the ozone sensitivity of natural vegetation in northern Europe are contradictive. \citet{FS:Subramanian2014} reported a higher, modeled reduction of net primary production in conifers ($4.3-15.5\,\unit{\%}$) than birch ($1.4-4.3\,\unit{\%}$) under elevated ozone in Sweden, while \citet{Amb:Girgzdiene2009} observed more visible damage on deciduous trees than on Norway spruce in Lithuania. But visible damage and biomass reduction may not occur at the same rate and hence may not be interchangeable. 

In our study, we do not explicitly account for this natural distribution of individual plant traits, but our bespoke response functions reflect the diversity within a given species. In particular, we assumed two tolerance levels to cold temperatures than for central European species. To this end, we computed a PDF from observed temperature at Svanhovd (May--September 1992--2000). We adjusted the parameters in the temperature response function of stomatal conductance to increase the enclosed area with the PDF. Assuming a proportionality between $g_\mathrm{sto}$ and $A_\mathrm{n}$, this is equivalent to optimizing carbon uptake. Similarly, we determined a PPFD PDF and varied the light response function to test a higher or lower extent of stomatal opening at low light intensities. Remark that these parameterizations are hypothetical and need verification by experimental data. We found that soil water potential under 2018/19 meteorological conditions was negligible when considering the bespoke growing season. We have not assessed the effect of the plants' response to VPD in detail, but our climatological data indicated that conditions at Svanhovd are shifting towards a more VPD limited regime. 

Our key findings are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our bespoke parameterizations for subarctic species are better suited to describe vegetation adapted to subarctic conditions for instance allowing for stomata opening during a larger part of the growing season, 
\item the parameterizations defined in the mapping manual for European regional risk assessment appear to not adequately capture the physiological responses of subarctic vegetation that are important determinants of \chem{[O_3]} susceptibility and are likely to underestimate ozone-damage risk, and 
\item climatic conditions that are promoting a longer growing season are likely to increase the ozone-damage risk in flux-based metrics.
\end{enumerate}

In this regard, vegetation might become more exposed to higher ozone concentrations in early phenological stages due to an overlap with ozone spring peak \citep{EP:Karlsson2007}. However, the decline of this ozone spring peak is partly caused by the uptake of vegetation. It, therefore, remains unclear whether an earlier start of the growing season will increase the exposure of vegetation to ozone or lead to compensation due to an earlier decline of the peak ozone in the future. \citet{ESPR:Hayes2021} pointed out that the highest susceptibility of vegetation to future ozone variability is likely to occur in summer when vegetation is most productive. The actual resilience of northern Fennoscandia plant communities to climate change strongly depends on both the range of existing acclimations as well as the actual type of acclimation. This means vegetation that is acclimated to cold temperatures and little to heat- and drought stress might suffer more strongly from a more frequent occurence of heatwaves than plants that have a higher temperature tolerance.

Following the methods described in \citet{ICP:MappingManual2017}, we estimated biomass reductions due to ozone uptake for both 2018 and 2019 and found substantial reductions for deciduous trees ($15.5-17.4\,\unit{\%}$) and perennial grassland (above ground, $12.4-13.7\,\unit{\%}$) in both years. These reductions are higher than for the default parameterizations, $11.2\,\unit{\%}$ (deciduous) and $9.6\,\unit{\%}$ (perennial grassland). For coniferous trees, the estimated reduction in biomass differs insignificantly between our bespoke parameterizations ($2.5-3\,\unit{\%}$) and the default ($2.31\,\unit{\%}$). This indicates a higher modeled robustness to ozone damage in coniferous trees. All these results have to be treated with care because the biomass reduction functions were established based on studies from less extreme climates. In particular, CLs for deciduous and coniferous trees were breached in all years and for all parameterizations. For perennial grassland, the CL was not breached if a bespoke GS was assumed, but the mapping manual defined CL of $10\,\unit{\%}$ loss in biomass might not be transferable to subarctic regions with considerable constraints on productivity leading to more severe economical consequences.

Beyond the risk assessment of ozone-induced damage, our bespoke temperature response functions, once verified by observations, can have important implications on land-surface modeling in global models, where problems in productivity of species especially in the Arctic regions occur due to PFTs which are not suitable for the climate. We pointed out, concerning default perennial grassland parameterization, that these perennial grasslands did not show any substantial stomatal conductance in 2019 characterized as a normal year. In terms of GPP this would mean unrealistically low carbon uptake. Automation of the here proposed PDF-based acclimation using machine learning techniques could overcome these issues in the future.

\subsection{Initial $\mathrm{DO_3SE}$ modeling results with mapping manual parameters}
To demonstrate the necessary acclimation of the mapping manual parameters, we show the initial results of stomatal conductance at leaf-level ($G_\mathrm{sto}^\mathrm{leaf}$) and $\mathrm{POD_y}$ over \unit{doy} for both years and all PFTs (Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_mm_composit}). Observed \chem{[O_3]} is also indicated. From Fig.~\ref{fig:pody_mm_composit}f) it is apparent that the mapping manual parameterized grassland would not have been able to grow in 2019.

\subsection{Bespoke parameterizations}

To assess the $G_\mathrm{start}$  and $G_\mathrm{end}$ of the growing season for coniferous trees at Svanhovd in 2018/19, we used the net photosynthesis product ($A_\mathrm{net}$) of MODIS AQUA/TERRA over a $1\times 1\,\unit{km}$ area centered at Svanhovd. MODIS data indicate a higher photosynthetic activity in 2018 than in 2019. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:modis_gpp} we fitted a second order polynomial function of the general form
%
\begin{equation}
A_\mathrm{net}(t) =  -m_0\cdot(t-m_1)^2+m_2,
\end{equation}
%
with the form parameters $m_i$ through the data. Numerically, we retrieved the roots as $G_\mathrm{start}$ 122/106 and $G_\mathrm{end}$ 261/274 for 2018 and 2019, respectively.

As described in Section~\ref{subsec:do3se_parameters}, we developed bespoke parameterizations for natural and semi-natural vegetation at Svanhovd. Here, we show the temperature response and light response functions for coniferous and deciduous trees (Figs.~\ref{fig:f_temp_spruce}-\ref{fig:f_temp_birch}).

(a) $f_\mathrm{T}$ and (b) $f_\mathrm{flight}$ are shown together with underlying $T_\mathrm{air}$ and $Q_0$ climatologies (probability density function - PDF), respectively. Original mapping manual parameterization is shown in comparison as solid line. Note that $Q_0$ has been truncated to $0.006$. PPFD0.8 and PPFD1.2 refer to $\alpha$ values increasing/decreasing PPFD at $f_\mathrm{light}=0.5$ by $\pm 20\,\%$, respectively.}

\noappendix       %% use this to mark the end of the appendix section. Otherwise the figures might be numbered incorrectly (e.g. 10 instead of 1).

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

%\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures


%\noappendix

%\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
