\begin{abstract}
  The summer 2018 and summer 2019 did not differ significantly in the level of ozone. On the other hand, the temperatures (precipitation and cloud cover/PAR?) differed quite a lot. We also observed ozone-induced visible injuries on clovers in the ozone garden at Svanhovd in 2018, but not in 2019. This may be due to differences in uptake of ozone (POD) between the two years. Since DO3SE can be run on birch/beech and conifers, we would like to investigate whether the critical levels for these tree species were crossed during the two summer seasons. Ozone concentrations for the two missing weeks in July 2018 have been estimated based on the measurements from the Swedish and Finnish ozone measurement stations in the region.

\item ozone in general
\item ozone induced damage in vegetation \emph{Contributor: Ane - maybe also ask Aud?}
  Ozone acts as an oxidative stress to plants. Its main action is imposed through reactions occurring in the cell walls and cell membranes of mesophyll cells inside the leaves.Ozone enters the leaves through stomata, that are kept open to allow for gas exchange between the leaf air spaces and the exterior air. When the stomata are closed, ozone does not enter.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

In our assessment of ozone damage on vegetation in the subarctic in relation to the 2018 heatwave, we focus on the NIBIO operated Environment Centre Svanhovd which lies close by the settlement of Svanvik in the Pasvik valley (Section~\ref{subsec:svanhovd}). Throughout the paper, we will use Svanvik synonymously for the atmospheric monitoring site at Svanhovd. The available meteorological monitoring data are described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik}. In Section~\ref{subsubsec:ozone_garden}, the ozone garden -- a plant-based ozone monitoring -- will be described in more detail. Other data used for evaluation of the ozone data taken at Svanhovd is described in Section~\ref{subsec:other_data}. We compare with observational data from other monitoring sites in northern Fennoscandia (Section~\ref{subsubsec:ebas}) and use as well reanalysis products (Section~\ref{subsubsec:ozone_rea}) as complement when observational data was not available.

\subsection{NIBIO Environment Centre Svanhovd}
\label{subsec:svanhovd}
"Svanhovd is located beside the Pasvik river, in the middle of the wedge of Norwegian land separating Russia and Finland in the north. It is where the eastern Siberian taiga meets the western Boreal forest. [...] Svanhovd was originally established as a State Demonstration and Experimental Farm in the 1930's, in order to expand agriculture in Pasvik valley [...]" - \href{https://www.nibio.no/en/about-eng/addresses/northern-norway/svanhovd}{NIBIO web page, accessed March 2020}.

The locations of the atmospheric monitoring site as well as the ozone garden with respect to the main buildings of the Svanhovd Environment Centre are marked in the aerial photography shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:svanhovd_research_station}. The Centre is located south of the settlement of Svanvik, where as the border to Russia, the Pasvik river, lies only a few hundred meters to the east. The original farm buildings, protected by law, are located in the lower center, while the Svanhovd Environment Centre follows to the north-east. The Centre hosts offices, a conference center, a national park center, a brown bear exhibition as well as a modern laboratory for DNA analysis. Left of the Centre and north of the original farm buildings a botanical garden can be found. It is one amongst three such gardens north of the Polar Circle. The Svanhovd Environment Centre focuses on research of the special environment of the region, but also comprises long-term observations of various agrameteorological variables, i.a. $2\,\unit{m}$ temperature, precipitation, global irradiance, and soil temperature at different depths.

For the purpose of relating observed damage on ozone sensitive plants (e.g. clover and tobacco) to local ozone concentrations, an ozone monitor had been installed during the growing seasons 2018/19. The relevant data are described in more detail in Section~\ref{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik}.

\subsubsection{Atmospheric monitoring}
\label{subsubsec:atmo_svanvik}
For the growing seasons 2018/19, monitoring data of key variables (temperature, precipitation, and ozone) have been downloaded from \href{luftkvalitet.no}{luftkvalitet.no} which is operated by NILU.

All agrameteorological variables including temperature and precipitation are available from September 1992 to present day (LandbruksMeteorologisk Tjeneste provided by NIBIO -- \href{https://lmt.nibio.no/}{lmt.nibio.no}, note the station name here is Pasvik).

{\bf TODO: Some more (technical) details about ozone and atmospheric monitoring at Svanhovd. $\rightarrow$ Sverre?}

\emph{Comment: We refrain from doing a full cross-evaluation for these meteorological fields, since this has been done elsewhere. It's somewhat clear that this is a job of the operators in the monitoring network.} {\bf TODO: Find a citation for this.}.

Relevant data for the growing season 2018/19 are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}. The hatched areas mark times when no ozone data has been taken. Note, while the downtime during winter was planed, missing data in two weeks of July 2018 were due to problems in data acquisition.

Ozone concentrations \chem{[O_3]} measured in $2\,\unit{m}$ height above ground are averaged hourly. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}a), \chem{[O_3]} peaks in spring (April/May) and reaches its minimum in late summer (July/August). The spring peak has not been captured completely in 2019, for data acquisition started later than in 2018. In 2018, high summer ozone concentrations ($\chem{[O_3]}> 40\,\unit{ppb}$) were observed in July. A part of these peak values may, however, coincident with the time period of missing data. In the summer of 2019, ozone concentrations stayed below the threshold of $40\,\unit{ppb}$ most of the times.

Hourly averaged $2\,\unit{m}$ temperatures below $-20\,\unit{^\circ C}$ were observed in winter (January/February), while high temperatures (above $20\,\unit{^\circ C}$) occurred in summer (July), though more regularly in 2018 than in 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}b). In 2018, temperature regularly rose above freezing only in May, while in 2019 this occurred already early in March/April. 2019 saw a very cold November with temperatures regularly below $-10\unit{^\circ C}$.

More rain events with accumulated daily precipitation $\sum_d \mathrm{Precip}$ above $10\,\unit{mm}$ occurred in the summer of 2018 compared to 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}c). $\sum_d \mathrm{Precip} \ge 20\,\unit{mm}$ was only breached twice in 2018 and once in 2019.

In 2018, global irradiance $Q_0$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:data_svanvik_2018_2019}d) displays more sequentially high values in spring (May) and summer (July) compared to 2019, while June 2019 saw more consecutive high irradiance than 2018. In both years, the maximum recorded $Q_0$ was roughly $750\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$ reached only in June.

\subsection{Other data}
\label{subsec:other_data}
To determine the significance of the ozone conditions in 2018, we have to derive a surface ozone concentration climatology for Svanvik. From 1986--1996 ozone monitoring has been operated by NILU at Svanhovd, but no ozone measurements have been conducted for the past $14\,\unit{years}$. Due to probable changes in northern hemispheric tropospheric background ozone and a reduction of summertime peak values related to ozone precursors that fell under air quality regulations {\bf TODO: Citations!}, we also have to have a look at ozone observations at other sites in northern Fennoscandia. In regard to ozone, available observational data are sparse in this region. An overview over the geographical locations of conducted atmospheric monitoring in the past and present is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:station_map_fennoscandia}. The data is described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:ebas}. 
As additional complement to observational data which is not available at all times and spatially sparse, we also look at various ozone reanalysis products (Section~\ref{subsubsec:ozone_rea}).

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{station_map_fennoscandia}
  \caption{Cap of the North. Locations of past and present ozone observation sites in northern Fennoscandia used within this study. For more details see Tab.~\ref{tab:ebas_obs}. The same color coding for each station as displayed herein will be used in all following figures.}
  \label{fig:station_map_fennoscandia}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Surface ozone observations}
\label{subsubsec:ebas}
All surface ozone observations used in this study are available from the EBAS database operated by NILU (\href{http://ebas.nilu.no/}{ebas.nilu.no}). In Table~\ref{tab:ebas_obs}, we give an overview over the exact locations and time range of operational data taking. All stations with available long term observations are locate on higher ground than Svanhovd which will result in higher surface ozone concentrations in comparison as ozone abundance, in general, decreases with decreasing altitude in the absence of local precursors. {\bf TODO: Citation!} {\bf TODO: The following has to be confirmed and elaborated on! Ane?} The vegetation at all sites is similar and consists mainly of pine forests, birch, and heath.

Data from before the 1990s is available solely from Svanvik and Karasjok. These data, however, do not follow the high quality standard procedures implemented nowadays and have to be treated with care {\bf TODO: citation NILU ozone report 200x}. Especially, ozone monitors did not undergo a regular re-calibration. This leads likely to drifts in the observed data and may impose a false periodicity. In 1997, the ozone monitoring at Jergul was relocated downstream the river Karasjokka to a site close by Karasjok. Although the same equipment has been used, this might have introduced a breaking point in the combined data series denoted as Jergul/Karasjok in the following which would be of a problem if this was the sole data to compare with. Only few data have been taken upstream the Pasvik river at Janiskovski, hence these will not be taken into further consideration, but are shown for completion. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_timesseries_fenoscandic_obs}, there is an overlap of about $4\,\unit{years}$ between data taken at Esrange, Jergul/Karasjok, and Svanvik. The hatched areas indicate time periods with insufficient quality control as mentioned above.

\subsubsection{Ozone reanalysis}
\label{subsubsec:ozone_rea}

Details of reanalysis data sets referred to in this work are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ozone_rea}.
There are two global reanalysis products available at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that include atmospheric tracers, in particular ozone (MACC and CAMSRA). The temporal as well as spatial resolution of these reanalysis products is rather coarse: 3-hourly and $0.75^\circ\times 0.75^\circ$ or roughly $78.1\,\unit{km}\times 83.4\,\unit{km}$ at the location of Svanvik, respectively. In addition, higher resolution surface ozone reanalysis for whole Europe is available from Copernicus service for regional air quality control. The regional model reanalysis ensemble mean is at fairly high spatial and temporal resolution compared to the data from ECMWF: $0.1^\circ\times 0.1^\circ$ or roughly $10.4\,\unit{km}\times 11.1\,\unit{km}$ and 1-hourly, respectively. The covered time periods differ and no data are available for before the turn of the millennium. The CAMSRA and CAMS Regional Air Quality ensemble mean are available in near real time, but only former covers a period of sufficient length for climate analysis (2003 -- present). Their quality with respect to observations will be discussed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:clim_ozone}. Without too much foreshadowing, the results prevented us from fetching the whole CAMSRA data.

\section{Statistical analysis of atmospheric key variables}
In this section, we will evaluate atmospheric conditions in the growing seasons of 2018/19 by statistical means. We will derive climatologies for both, temperature, precipitation, global irradiance, and ozone for Svanvik (Section~\ref{subsec:climatologies}). The ozone measurements will be put into a climatological as well as regional context. We will look at anomalies of the atmospheric key variable mentioned above (Section~\ref{subsec:anomalies}).

\subsection{Derived climatologies}
\label{subsec:climatologies}

\subsubsection{Temperature, precipitation, and global irradiance}
\label{subsubsec:clim_temp_prec}
The location of Svanvik at $69.45\,\unit{^\circ N}$ suggests a subarctic climate. The derived climate diagram following Walter and Lieth shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:climatediagram} supports this very well. The diagram is based on climatological data from Svanvik (1992--2012) downloaded from LandbruksMeteorologiske Tjeneste. Monthly averaged temperatures (red line) are displayed with standard error of mean as error band. Averaged monthly accumulated precipitation (blue bars) is shown with standard deviation of mean as error bars. Months with average temperatures below freezing are denoted with a star. As can be seen, temperatures stay below freezing for 5 consecutive months, while only 2 months breach $10\,\unit{^\circ C}$ regularly (July, August), satisfying the conditions for K\"{o}ppens climate classification of a regular subarctic climate (Dfc). The highest monthly average temperature is $(13.1\pm 1.1)\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in July and the lowest $(-12.8\pm 2.0)\,\unit{^\circ C}$ in February. In the time period 1992--2012, the coldest measured temperature was $-45.2\,\unit{^\circ C}$ observed January 27, 1999, while the highest temperature on July 16 the same year was $29.4\,\unit{^\circ C}$.

Winter and spring (November--April, except for March) are relatively dry ($\sum_m \mathrm{Precip} < 20\,\unit{mm}$). The driest month is January with $\sum_m \mathrm{Precip} = (16.7\pm 3.0)\,\unit{mm}$. The most precipitation occurs in the summer months, with a highest monthly averaged accumulated precipitation $\sum_m \mathrm{Precip} = (58.5\pm 9.2)\,\unit{mm}$ in August. The average annual accumulated precipitation given with standard error of mean is $(383\pm 86)\,\unit{mm}$. Precipitation shows a large variability throughout the years.

A climatology derived for global irradiance $Q_0$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:global_rad_clim}a) for both, climatological average of hourly maximum $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{max}\right>$, minimum $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{min}\right>$, and mean $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{mean}\right>$ irradiance observed at Svanvik. In agreement with the geometrically derived sunshine duration shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sunlight_fennoscandia}, $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{max}\right>$ approaches zero in December/January commonly known as polar night and reaches its maximum in June/July commonly referred to as midnight sun conditions. The highest observed $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{max}\right>$ is about $800\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$, while on average $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{mean}\right>$ it is about $450\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$ (regularly reached in May--July). The maximum of the climatological minimum $\left<Q_0^\mathrm{min}\right>$ lies at about $200\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{climatediagram}
  \caption{Climate diagram following Walter and Lieth. The diagram is based on climatological data for Svanvik/Pasvik (1992--2012) downloaded from LandbruksMeteorologiske Tjeneste.

Averaged monthly accumulated precipitation (blue bars) is shown with standard deviation of mean as error bars. Months with average temperatures below freezing are denoted with a star.}
  \label{fig:climatediagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Ozone}
\label{subsubsec:clim_ozone}
In the following, we will look at derived ozone climatologies from different perspectives.
The multi-annual means of daily mean ozone, for simplicity here without standard deviations, at observation sites in northern Fennoscandia (refer to Table~\ref{tab:ebas_obs} for details) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}. All climatologies peak in spring, with peak values of about $48\,\unit{ppb}$ in late April. The annual average ozone concentration \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} declines throughout the growing season until it reaches its minimum in late summer/fall ($24-30\,\unit{ppb}$). The turning points lie approximately in June and November. The ozone climatology lags about 3 months behind the temperature climatology. At Svanvik, \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} is $6.6\,\unit{ppb}$ lower than on sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN). The large spread in case of Svanvik and Janiskoski can be explained due to the lower overall statistics.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}
  \caption{Multi-annual mean of daily mean ozone at observation sites in Fennoscandia. The large spread in case of Svanvik and Janiskoski is due to the lower statistics. All climatologies peak in spring, with peak values in April. The annual average ozone concentration \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} at Svanvik is $6.6\,\unit{ppb}$ lower than at the sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN).}
  \label{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs}
\end{figure}

The correlation of \chem{[O_3]} between Esrange, Pallas, and Jergul/Karasjok is fairly high ($r^2\approx 0.8$, Fig.~\ref{fig:density_distribution}a, b), hence we can put those data series together to derive a general ozone climatology for northern Fennoscandia. The correlation between Svanvik and Esrange and Pallas is rather low, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. Thus, Svanvik cannot directly be represented by any measurements taken at either Esrange or Pallas.

In Figure~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}, the 2 dimensional density distributions for the thus defined northern Fennoscandia (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}a) and Svanvik (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}b) are shown. Darker colors indicate higher probability to observe these values. On top of the density distributions, $10\,\unit{days}$ averages of daily mean \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, daily maximum \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}}, and daily minimum \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, min}} are displayed together with the $1 \sigma$ uncertainties, respectively. In addition, \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}} is also shown with standard error of mean (albeit small and hardly visible). Splines have been fitted through the data for easier inter-comparison with reanalysis data.

From the northern Fennoscandic climatology, one can deduce several features. The maximum of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, min}} peaks about $20\,\unit{days}$ earlier than the \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, and \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}}. With respect to the periodicity of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, it takes about $8.5\,\unit{months}$ from minimum concentration to maximum concentration, while from maximum to minimum it only takes about $4.5\,\unit{months}$. The maximum of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}} is at $52\,\unit{ppb}$ in late April and the minimum of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, min}} occurs at $15\,\unit{ppb}$ in the beginning of September. The steep rise of \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}} in spring coincident with increasing temperatures as well as increase in global irradiance. The decrease in \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}} coincides with the estimated onset of the greening season based on the agricultural rule of thumb that the daily average temperature has to be above $5\,\unit{^\circ C}$ for $5\,\unit{days}$ consecutively (day of the year 110--150 at Svanvik, Fig~\ref{fig:greening_season_change_Svanvik}).

The density distribution for Svanvik and the respective \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, mean}}, and \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>_\mathrm{10\,\unit{d}, max}} (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}b) display a similar pattern as the northern Fennoscandic climatology. The spring peak apparently occurs slightly earlier (in the beginning of April). As Svanvik is located lower than the other sites, the earlier ozone peak may point to a strong interplay between ozone uptake by vegetation after the onset of greening, for at higher altitude plants sprout later. The average ozone concentration at Svanvik is lower than at the other sites, as already mentioned, which is in league with a decrease in tropospheric ozone with decreasing altitude. In July--September, ozone is occasionally almost completely depleted during night time.

  \caption{Derivation of ozone climatologies. Density distributions are shown together with multi-annual mean of daily ozone concentrations \chem{[O_3]}. Splines have been fitted though daily mean and max \chem{[O_3]}. The climatology of daily mean ozone is shown together with $1\,\sigma$ standard deviation and standard error of the mean. Since \chem{[O_3]} are strongly correlated for sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN) (see Fig.~\ref{fig:density_distribution}), data of these have been averaged together to derive a climatology for northern Fennoscandia. (a) Northern Fennoscandia; (b) Svanvik.}
  \label{fig:ozone_climatology_fenoscandic_obs_spline}
\end{figure}

Finally, we shall look at the comparison of climatologies derived from observational ozone data and the various reanalysis products (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}). As representative for the sites, the nearest neighboring grid point has been chosen. The ECMWF products do not reproduce observed surface ozone well. The MACC reanalysis (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}a) is in general too low ($(9\pm 7)\,\unit{ppb}$) and displays a erroneous seasonal cycle. MACC reanalysis ozone concentrations peak already in March followed by a second peak in July. Also CAMSRA matches the observed ozone climatology hardly (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}b). Despite displaying only one ozone peak, it still does not reproduce the seasonality in northern Fennoscandia at all. The CAMSRA spring peak appears to lag behind by $1\,\unit{month}$ and is $5\,\unit{ppb}$ lower, whereas the minimum occurs in January compared to August/September. The annual amplitude ($(26\pm 1)\,\unit{ppb}$) is larger than in the climatology derived from observations ($19\,\unit{ppb}$). Modeled \chem{[O_3]} at Svanvik are even slightly higher than at Pallas. In contrast, the ensemble mean of the Copernicus regional model reanalysis does reproduce the seasonal cycle in northern Fennoscandia quite well (Fig.~\ref{fig:ozone_climatologies}c), but is on average still slightly too low ($(2.8\pm 0.5)\,\unit{ppb}$).

As representative for the sites, the nearest neighboring grid point has been chosen. The ECMWF products do not reproduce observed surface ozone well. The MACC reanalysis is in general too low and displays a erroneous seasonal cycle. The CAMS reanalysis matches better but does not reproduce the seasonality in northern Fennoscandia. The ensemble mean of the Copernicus regional model reanalysis does reproduce the seasonal cycle in northern Fennoscandia, though the modeled ozone concentrations are slightly too low.}

\subsection{2018/19 anomalies}
\label{subsec:anomalies}
Using the established climatologies, we look at the anomalies in 2018/19 and the differences between the two years. 

\subsubsection{Temperature, precipitation, and global irradiance}
\label{subsubsec:anomal_tpq}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:plot_temperature_anomalies_svanvik}, temperature anomalies at Svanvik are shown as percentage of days warmer/colder than $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are displayed as negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). The summer of 2018 was significantly warmer than average. Especially in May and July more than $40\,\unit{\%}$ of days were significantly warmer than normal temperature. Temperatures continued to be significantly warmer throughout fall into early winter (August--November) with the exception of October. March 2018 was unusually cold. The summer of 2019 was fairly average, however significantly colder in July, while August was both significantly colder and warmer. Temperatures in April were significantly warmer than average.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{temperature_signific}
  \caption{Temperature anomalies at Svanvik. Percentage of days warmer/colder than $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from climatological mean displayed for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are shown as negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). Year displayed in panel (a) 2018; (b) 2019. The summer of 2018 was significantly warmer than average, especially May and July. The summer of 2019 was fairly average but significantly warmer than average in April and colder in July/August.}
  \label{fig:plot_temperature_anomalies_svanvik}
\end{figure}

In a similar way, the precipitation anomalies at Svanvik are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:plot_precipitation_anomalies_svanvik}. However, the percentage of days wetter/drier than $\pm \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean is shown for each month, due to the larger variability in observed precipitation too few days showed a significance of $1 \sigma$ or higher. As above, negative deviations from the climatology are shown as negative percentage and annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners. The dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of values falling above $\pm\frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($30.8\,\unit{\%}$). Unlike for the temperature anomalies, the picture is not as clear. While March 2018 was unusually wet, summer and fall (May/July, September/October) were significantly drier than average. 2019 was rather average throughout the year, with drier than usual fall (September/October) and a wet December.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{precipitation_signific}
  \caption{Precipitation anomalies at Svanvik. Percentage of days wetter/drier than $\pm \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ from climatological mean displayed for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are shown as negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of values falling above $\pm\frac{1}{2}\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($30.8\,\unit{\%}$). Year displayed in panel (a) 2018; (b) 2019. The summer of 2018 was significantly drier than in 2019.}
  \label{fig:plot_precipitation_anomalies_svanvik}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the global irradiance anomalies at Svanvik are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:global_rad_signific}. The percentage of days above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from the climatological mean is displayed for each month. The dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed. In summer 2018 (May/July), global irradiance was significantly higher than on average, while 2019 was generally an average year with a lightly darker spring (April/May).

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{global_rad_signific}
  \caption{Global irradiance anomalies at Svanvik. Percentage of days above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ from climatological mean displayed for each month. Negative deviations from climatology are shown as negative percentage. The annual positive/negative deviations are indicated in the respective corners (right upper/right lower). The dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of values falling above/below $\pm 1\,\sigma$ if a normal distribution is assumed ($15.9\,\unit{\%}$). Year displayed in panel (a) 2018; (b) 2019. In summer 2018 (May/July), global irradiance was significantly higher than on average, while 2019 was generally an average year.}
  \label{fig:global_rad_signific}
\end{figure}

In summary, 2018 was significantly warmer, drier, and lighter than the climatological average, while 2019 was a rather average year.

\subsubsection{Ozone}
\label{subsubsec:anomal_ozone}
As we have found above, meteorological conditions in 2018 were significantly above average. How does this translate into observed ozone anomalies?
