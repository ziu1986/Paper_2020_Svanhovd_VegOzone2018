\begin{abstract}
  The summer 2018 and summer 2019 did not differ significantly in the level of ozone. On the other hand, the temperatures (precipitation and cloud cover/PAR?) differed quite a lot. We also observed ozone-induced visible injuries on clovers in the ozone garden at Svanhovd in 2018, but not in 2019. This may be due to differences in uptake of ozone (POD) between the two years. Since DO3SE can be run on birch/beech and conifers, we would like to investigate whether the critical levels for these tree species were crossed during the two summer seasons. Ozone concentrations for the two missing weeks in July 2018 have been estimated based on the measurements from the Swedish and Finnish ozone measurement stations in the region.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

In our assessment on ozone damage on vegetation is the subarctic in relation to the 2018 heatwave, we focus on the NIBIO operated local site Svanhovd which lies close by the settlement of Svanvik in the Pasvik valley. Throughout the paper, we will use Svanvik synonymously for the atmospheric monitoring site at Svanhovd. For the purpose of this study, we evaluate data taken at Svanhovd (Section~\ref{subsec:svanhovd}) with observational data from other monitoring sites in northern Fennoscandia (Section~\ref{subsec:obs_data}). Reanalysis data is used as complement where observational data was not available or temporally sparse (Section~\ref{subsec:model_data}).

\subsection{NIBIO research station Svanhovd}
\label{subsec:svanhovd}
"Svanhovd is located beside the Pasvik river, in the middle of the wedge of Norwegian land separating Russia and Finland in the north. It is where the eastern Siberian taiga meets the western Boreal forest. [...] Svanhovd was originally established as a State Demonstration and Experimental Farm in the 1930's, in order to expand agriculture in Pasvik valley [...]" - \href{https://www.nibio.no/en/about-eng/addresses/northern-norway/svanhovd}{NIBIO}\\ The research station and locations of the atmospheric monitoring site and the ozone garden are shown in the aerial photography (Fig.~\ref{fig:station_map_fennoscandia}). Svanhovd comprises atmospheric monitoring (ozone monitoring exclusively for the summer seasons 2018/19) and observed ozone damage in plants.

\subsection{Other observational data}
\label{subsec:obs_data}
For the purpose of this study, we are interested in past and present observations of surface ozone concentrations and meteorological conditions in northern Fennoscandia. This limits the available observational data to a handful of atmospheric monitoring sites. An overview over their geographical locations is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:station_map_fennoscandia}.

\subsubsection{Surface ozone observations}
\label{subsubsec:ebas}
All surface ozone observations used in this study are available from NILU EBAS database except for the data for the 2018/19 summer season at Svanhovd. In Table~\ref{tab:ebas_obs}, we give an overview over the exact locations and time range of operational data taking.

\subsection{Reanalysis data}
\label{subsec:model_data}
Different reanalysis products have been used to evaluate and complement the observational data.

\subsubsection{Ozone}
\label{subsubsec:ozone_rea}
There are two global reanalysis products of ECMWF available that include also ozone. In addition, higher resolution surface ozone reanalysis for Europe is available from Copernicus service for regional air quality control. The details are given in Tab.~\ref{tab:ozone_rea}. The covered time periods differ but are sufficient for our purpose of comparison of derived ozone climatologies.

The large spread in case of Svanvik and Janiskoski is due to the lower statistics. All northern Fennoscandic climatologies peak in spring, with peak values in April. In southern Norway, peak values appear only in May. The annual average ozone concentration \chem{\left<[O_3]\right>} at Svanvik is $6.6\,\unit{ppb}$ lower than at the sites at Jergul/Karasjok (NOR), Esrange (SWE), and Pallas (FIN).}

As representative for the sites, the nearest neighboring grid point has been chosen. The ECMWF products do not reproduce observed surface ozone well. The MACC reanalysis is in general too low and displays a erroneous seasonal cycle. The CAMS reanalysis matches quite well in southern Fennoscandia but does not reproduce the seasonality in northern Fennoscandia. The ensemble mean of the Copernicus regional model reanalysis does reproduce the seasonal cycle in both northern and southern Fennoscandia, though the ozone concentrations in the north are slightly to low.}

%%%
%%% Physical quantities/variables are typeset in italic font (t for time, T for Temperature)
%%% Indices which are not defined are typeset in italic font (x, y, z, a, b, c)
%%% Items/objects which are defined are typeset in roman font (Car A, Car B)
%%% Descriptions/specifications which are defined by itself are typeset in roman font (abs, rel, ref, tot, net, ice)
%%% Abbreviations from 2 letters are typeset in roman font (RH, LAI)
%%% Vectors are identified in bold italic font using \vec{x}
%%% Matrices are identified in bold roman font
%%% Multiplication signs are typeset using the LaTeX commands \times (for vector products, grids, and exponential notations) or \cdot
