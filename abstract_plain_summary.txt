# Abstract plain text

The unique vegetation of the subarctic region, acclimatized to extremes of cold and midnight sun, is likely to be at threat from the combined impacts of climate change and increasing ozone concentrations [O3]. To date, only a few studies have assessed the response of subarctic vegetation to variations in climate and air pollution. This study looks to fill this knowledge gap by examining the uncertainty in risk assessments that result from using Boreal rather than subarctic paramterizations. With no parameterization of stomatal response of subarctic vegetation available, we propose an adjustment of existing Boreal parameterizations based on local climate conditions. To this end, we vary the temperature response function according to the climatological temperature distribution during the growing season at our site. We refer to this approach as a ’local climate derived parameterization’ of stomatal response functions. We also study the impact of the stomata aperture parameterization at low light intensities. With these, we apply the integrated flux-metric Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD) to determine ozone risk and damage to vegetation as a function of [O3], key environmental variables, and species-specific physiology. In addition, we evaluate the extent to which two recent years (2018 and 2019) deviate from climatic and [O3] norms and find that 2018 was an anomalously warm and less cloudy year, particularly in spring and early summer. Higher than average [O3] was observed in April/May while frequent episodes of ozone volume mixing ratios (VMRs) exceeding 40 ppb occurred in June–August. These episodes are in part attributable to forest fires in the Northern Hemisphere and warmer and sunnier conditions caused by an extensive blocking event. Such conditions might be more likely in the future under advancing climate change. In contrast, 2019
was an average year. Our modeling study suggests that using standard Boreal parameterizations in assessments likely leads to underestimating the risk of ozone damage in this region for some species. We find that local climate-derived parameterizations for subarctic vegetation result in an ozone-induced biomass loss of 2.5-17.4 %. For some species, this loss is up to 55 % larger than that projected from Boreal parameterizations used in general assessments. Efforts should be targeted towards accurately defining subarctic vegetations’ physiological response to essential climate variables.

We derive subarctic parameterizations of stomatal conductance for the DO3SE model by varying existing Jarvis-type Boreal temperature response functions based on local climate conditions. For the growing seasons 2018 and 2019, we find an ozone-induced biomass loss of 2.5-17.4 % that is up to 55 % larger than that projected from Boreal parameterizations. This indicates that accurately defining subarctic vegetations’ physiological response to essential climate variables is essential.
