\section*{Authors' response}
To bg-2021-260-RC1 (05 Nov 2021):
We thank the anonymous referee \#1 for their comments.
We will address all \textbf{general comments} raised regarding the structure and readability of the manuscript in our next revision. We will refine the language to reduce ambiguity and supplement our statements with appropriate citations where indicated by the referee.\\
As the manuscript will, hence, undergo major structural changes, we can not address all \textbf{specific / technical comments} in detail at this point. In the next revision of the manuscript, we will take all specific and technical comments which are still relevant into consideration.\\
In the following, we shall respond to all issues where reasonable at this point.

\subsection*{Genral comments} 
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item {\color{blue} "the [...] study is highly speculative and not based on any experimental evidence [...]"} We are aware that our work is not complemented by experimental evidence and did not claim otherwise. We welcome relevant observational data to further improve parameterizations of Arctic and subarctic species. We ought to stress that we do not own the "true" parameterization for subarctic vegetation but assess the uncertainty arising from the use of generic parameterizations.
    \item {\color{blue} "Many claims sound superficial [...], such as [...] the alleged deviation of the years 2018 and 2019 from the site's climatology [...]"} We strongly disagree with this statement. We assessed the particular years 2018 and 2019 by statistical means with respect to our derived climatologies. We acknowledge that we have not used common tools such as the infamous \emph{p-value} (for a discussion see \href{https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108}{statement of the American Statistical Association (2016)}).
    \item {\color{blue} "The manuscript is too long and the organization is confused  [...] no clear division between methodological section and results section"} We will address this in the next revision.

\end{itemize}
