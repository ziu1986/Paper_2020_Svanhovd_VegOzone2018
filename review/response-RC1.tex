\section*{Authors' response}
To bg-2021-260-RC1 (05 Nov 2021):
We thank the anonymous referee \#1 for their comments.
We will address the \textbf{major comments} raised regarding the structure and readability of the manuscript in our next revision. We will refine the language to reduce ambiguity.\\
As the manuscript will, hence, undergo major structural changes, we have to refrain from addressing all \textbf{specific comments} in detail at this point. In the final revision of the manuscript, we will take all specific comments which are still relevant into consideration. 

Here, we shall give a brief response to questions where it seems appropriate.
